Learn more about the teenager who plays Jake on the Showtime drama ‘The Chi.’</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Considering his growing role on the Showtime drama <a href=#>The Chi</a>, viewers are curious about young actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael V. Epps</a>, his parents, and whether he’s related to comedian <a href=#>Mike Epps</a> of Next Friday and The Upshaws fame.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, it doesn’t seem like Michael is a relative of Mike’s, though the two do have a connection, as you’ll see below. Here’s more information on this talented teenager…</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael Epps’ mom, Keisha Johnson, is also his “momager.”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forest Park Review</a> profiled Michael and his family in 2019 ahead of The Chi’s second season. According to the newspaper, Michael’s mother, actress Keisha Johnson, introduced him to agents after watching him copy moves and lines on TV at home in Forest Park, Ill.</p><p>“We got a lot of no’s,” she said, “until he got a non-speaking part in one of the episodes of the popular TV series <a href=#>Empire</a>.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Then, in 2017, Michael auditioned for and landed the part of <a href=#>Jake</a> on The Chi, a boy at risk of falling in with his older brother’s gang life. “To see him play a part like Jake is so funny, because he’s the complete opposite of that kid,” Keisha said.</p><p>Gwendolyn Massey, Michael’s grandmother, concurred: “From day one, Michael has been a very good kid. He’s always been very loving and considerate,” she said. “He’s the first one to offer help.”</p><p>Now Keisha is working as Michael’s “momager,” not just managing his career but also driving him between school and set. “He keeps me busy,” she said. “I’m his acting coach, his manager, and his taxi driver. When he first got the part on The Chi I tried to be his manager and work a full-time job. I soon learned that I had to choose.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael isn’t related to Mike Epps, it seems, but he does list the comedian as one of his favorite actors.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>There’s no indication that Michael and Mike are related, but Michael is certainly aware of the other Hollywood star who shares his name. In a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">upfrontNY</a>, Michael named Mike as one of his favorite actors.</p><p>He also hyped up The Chi and its verisimilitude in the same interview. “The Chi is about events and situations that occur throughout the city [of Chicago],” he said. “They talk about real life situations. They talk about past situations that happened. They talk about the family functions that go on.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>He went on: “My character, Jake — I would say he plays an important part in The Chi because Jake is like something you see almost every day in Chicago. There’s a bunch of kids in Chicago like Jake. They have the wrong guidance. They don’t have a man at home to look up to like Jake. They don’t have a good father figure”</p><p>He also said working on The Chi “has been a great journey because this has been new to me. It’s a great experience. The journey is great. Along the way, I’ve met new people, new friends, and I really look forward to big things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2auXZq9sb%2BMqZirnZ6pwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adore-delano.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Adore Delano net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anita-briem.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anita Briem Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
