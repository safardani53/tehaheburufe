Although he is on the younger side of the spectrum, this teenager is not to be taken lightly.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The rapper, who celebrates his <a href=# rel=follow>birthday</a> on August 26, has amassed quite the following&nbsp;on his socials in a surprisingly narrow timeframe. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Understandably, being somewhat new to the game, fans have been curious about Lil Tecca. So, here are five facts you should know about the up-and-coming&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>rapper</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>1. He Started Rapping to Roast a Friend</h2><p>During a 2019 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Complex</a>, the 'Ransom' rapper recalled how he crafted his first bars to a beat. He explained that he and one of the first friends he made on Xbox&nbsp;used to go back and forth, roasting each other.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>The outlet reported he got tired of roasting his friend one day and decided to diss him on a track instead. One thing led to another, and in practically no time, the young rapper exploded.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Lil Tecca began rapping when he was in sixth grade and took the game more seriously in April 2017. Still, he has amassed a whopping 1.8 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, where his songs generate views in tens of millions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for Instagram, he boasts over 3.9 million followers on the platform as of this writing.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. His Real Name Is...</h2><p>Like with many other artists with monikers, fans have long questioned, "What is Lil Tecca's real name?"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>According to&nbsp;the podcast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Fresh Movement</a>, the rapper's real name is Tyler Sharpe. During his time on the internet radio show, he also revealed that Tecca was a name bestowed on him by a girl he knew. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>3. Where Is Lil Tecca from?</h2><p>In the aforementioned interview with Complex, the rapper also disclosed that he was brought up in Queens. He spent his early years in Springfield Gardens with his parents.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was in seventh grade, his family moved to Nassau County, Long Island. However, he does not lean into his Yankee roots when he puts on his rapper persona.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>4. He Does Not Identify as a New York Rapper</h2><p>Even when the outlet directly questioned him if he identified as a New York rapper, Lil Tecca diplomatically answered that he was whatever people thought he was.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the interview hinted that the rapper tried to underplay his New York upbringing to avoid&nbsp;being tied down to the signature New York rap style.</p><p>Because&nbsp;few people knew he was from New York, he did not have the same pressure to adhere to that specific sub-genre of rap music.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. His Relationships</h2><p>The information on Lil Tecca's love life is scarce, either because he is single or&nbsp;keeps his relationships tightly under wraps. Although, evidence would suggest the former is more accurate.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The rapper did&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">call out a Twitter user</a> by the username @lelyyyxo as his girlfriend on multiple counts. However, the last time he did so was in late 2018.</p><p>Since then, there have been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumors of him dating</a> a girl named Racquell. But, there isn't enough information available on the internet to confirm the speculations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZoXq1scKcmGaqlZa5brrAppxnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-statham-and-rosie-huntington-whiteley-2016-costume-institu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley: 2016 Costume Institute Gala</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bruce-willis-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of The Die Hard Actor Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
