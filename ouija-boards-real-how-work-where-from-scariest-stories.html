as well as a combination of the French and German words for 'yes'.</p><p>Some have warned against the use of ouija words, claiming they can lead to "demonic possession".</p><h2>Where do Ouija boards come from?</h2><p>Ouija boards have their roots in 19th century America, and the spiritualist movement.</p><p>The movement was led by mediums, who claimed to be intermediaries between the living and the dead.</p><p>Talking boards were soon established and, in 1891, businessman Elijah Bond decided to turn the board into a toy - which initially sold for around 75p.</p><p>Hasbro now owns the patents to Ouija boards.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><h2>Are Ouija boards real?</h2><p>There are three schools of thought when it comes to Ouija boards.</p><p>One, it's all a sham - and the person with their hand on the planchette is sneakily moving it around.</p><p>Two, they're a genuine portal to the spiritual world.</p><p>Three, they're possessed by demons and shouldn't be messed with - or disaster will ensue.</p><p>The truth is, as with ghosts and other paranormal goings on, nobody really knows.</p><p>But many people are scared of the boards, mainly because of stories like these...</p><h2>What are some of the scariest Ouija board stories?</h2><h3>Ghostly author</h3><p>Patience Worth was one of the most acclaimed writers of the earliest 20th century, despite having died more than 200 years earlier.</p><p>The authoress (1649-1694) supposedly communicated with St Louis housewife Pearl Lenore Curran (1883-1937) through her Ouija board.</p><p>Patience was supposedly a British woman who emigrated to New England in the late 1600s, and was killed by an Indian.</p><p>The New York Times called her first novel a "feat of literary composition".</p><p>Some believe Pearl simply made Patience up, in order to draw more attention to her work.</p><p>But others claim Pearl had a limited education and life experience, which would have made this impossible.</p><h3>Family murder</h3><p>In 1933, 15-year-old Mattie Turley, from San Diego, shot her own dad twice in the back - and then claimed the board had told her to do it.</p><p>Apparently, the board said she should commit the crime so her mum, Dorothea Irene Turley - who was holding the planchette at the time - could "marry a young cowboy".</p><p>Turley's mum insisted she followed the instructions, and both women were arrested. Turley's dad died in hospital, a couple of weeks after the shooting.</p><h3>Possessed by demons</h3><p>In July 1976, career criminal Gary Gilmore shot two men to death in Utah.</p><p>He was arrested, and became famous when he demanded to be executed for his crimes.</p><p>His younger brother, Mikal Gilmore, later wrote a book about their childhood.</p><p>In Shot In The Heart, he alleged their mum Bessie had contacted a demonic spirit through a Ouija board as a child - and was convinced it had attached itself to her family.</p><p>An accident in which one of Bessie's sisters was killed, and another paralysed, was also attributed to the demon.</p><h3>Grandma attack</h3><p>In February 2011, grandmother&nbsp;Carol Sue Elvaker, then 53, was using a Ouija board with her daughter Tammy, and Tammy's two daughters.</p><p>She is said to have received a message from God through the board, in which he said her son-in-law Brian Roach was evil and needed to be killed.</p><p>Elvaker grabbed a knife and stabbed Brian in his sleep, and then tried to kill Tammy's 10-year-old daughter.</p><p>Tammy sprang into action, wrestled the knife from her mum, and hid it in the house.</p><p>Elvaker then drove the group away from the house, but tried to kill them by running into a road sign.</p><p>She was later arrested, ruled insane and committed to a psychiatric hospital.</p><p>What troubles people is that Elvaker had no previous history of mental illness, drug or alcohol abuse.</p><h3>Serial killer calling</h3><p>In December 2007, Joshua Tucker, 16, and Donald&nbsp;Schalchlin, 15, asked a Ouija board if they should become serial killers.</p><p>The board supposedly said yes, and Tucker went on to kill&nbsp;Schalchlin's 13-year-old sister by stabbing her in the throat.</p><p>When&nbsp;Schalchlin's mum Lori went looking for her daughter, Tucker attacked her as well - and instructed&nbsp;Schalchlin to finish the job.</p><p>Lori died on her way to hospital. Her son was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison, while Tucker got a 41-year sentence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000363566216.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5NxZ2lpaWt8sMHIo5hmmp%2BWv6W%2FjKucmqRdnby4edaoqaRlp52ys7GMn6mopV2osKK%2ByJ6qrWWjqbyztcSsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kourtney-kardashian-did-she-pierce-her-four-year-olds-lip.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did She Pierce Her Four-Year-Old's Lip?!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./darnell-ferguson-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>'Tiny Food Fight' Co-Host Darnell Ferguson Is a Dad to Eight Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
