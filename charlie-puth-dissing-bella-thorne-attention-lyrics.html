It’s because Charlie’s&nbsp;fans believe the lyrics — which blast a girl for leading him on just to get&nbsp;attention — are all about his ex, <strong>Bella Thorne</strong>, 19!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>As you’ll recall, Charlie and Bella were seen holding hands and kissing in Miami&nbsp;in December 2016, all the while she was dating <strong>Tyler Posey</strong>. Rumors of a romance died down after Bella said she and Charlie, 25, weren’t dating. She did, however, call him an “angel” earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Obviously, nothing is for sure, but fans are convinced that “Attention” is about Bella.
