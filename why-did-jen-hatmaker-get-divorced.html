Back when everything was going down, Jen took to Instagram to tell fans that she and her family were "navigating an unexpected crisis."</p><p>She then clarified what it all meant in a subsequent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> to her feed. "We are in a moment with no handbook and without a single clue how to navigate this privately, much less publicly," she wrote. "I don’t know how to hide grief, so I haven't, and I am grateful for your absolute decency these last few weeks. I don’t know how to say this, and I still cannot believe I am even saying it, but Brandon and I are getting divorced."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When news of Jen and Brandon's split hit the internet, many fans <a href=#>speculated that the latter might have cheated</a> on the author.

The duo tied the knot all the way back in 1993 and are the proud parents of five kids: Sydney Beth, Ben, Gavin, Remy, and Caleb. The entire family was notably featured in the 2014 reality television series Your Big Family Renovation.</p><p>Jen and Brandon worked together to found the Austin New Church in Austin, Texas, where Joshua Harris, a certified pastor, preaches.</p><p>On top of that, the former couple co-founded the Legacy Collective, a non-profit organization that works to prevent child trafficking and aids people in receiving health care and securing affordable housing.</p><p>Although Brandon and Jen are no longer together, it's clear that the organizations that their relationship birthed are here to stay.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ailaN6qa3TppiknaJitKbAjJ2gr6eimLKl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aidan-gallagher-past-girlfriend-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Glance at 'The Umbrella Academy Star Aidan Gallaghers Previous Girlfriends</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-gabriel-basso-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gabriel Basso Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
