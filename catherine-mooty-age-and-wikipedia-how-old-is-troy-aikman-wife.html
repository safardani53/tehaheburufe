Aikman has two daughters, while Catherine is the mother of two sons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Catherine-Mooty-With-Her-Ex-Husband-Troy-Aikman.jpg><p><a href=#>Troy Kenneth Aikman</a> is a former NFL player who spent 20 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys (1989- 2000).&nbsp;</p><p>With the Cowboys, the jersey #8 quarterback won three Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, XXX).</p><p>He was the 1st overall pick in the 1989 NFL draft, followed by the top-five draftees: Tony Mandarich, <a href=#>Barry Sanders</a>, Derrick Thomas, and <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a>.</p><p>After his retirement, Aikman joined Fox News as its color commentator and worked for 20 seasons. Then, in 2022, he joined <a href=#>Joe Buck</a> as the lead commentator of Monday Night Football.</p><h2>Catherine Mooty Age And Wikipedia: How Old Is Troy Aikman’s Wife?</h2><p>Aikman’s second (now ex) wife, Catherine Mooty, was born on October 13, 1970, in Dallas, Texas, to George J.

After a year of dating, they engaged on June 2, 2017, during their gateway to Italy.</p><p>After three months of engagement, Mooty and Aikman married on September 1, 2017, at the Biltmore Four Seasons in Montecito, California.</p><p>Capa Aikman and Troy have not seen together since 2020, which led fans to speculate that they had split. It was confirmed after the latter was spotted <a href=# rel=noopener>vacationing with Haley Clark</a> in Italy in mid-2023.</p><p>Then, in July 2023, <a href=# rel=noopener>People’s Magazine confirmed</a> that the two had officially divorced.</p><h2>How Many Kids Does Capa Aikman Have?</h2><p>She is the mother of two kids from her first husband, Jerry Mooty.
