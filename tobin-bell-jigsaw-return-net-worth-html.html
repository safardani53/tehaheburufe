To date, he has made appearances in all eight of the movies in the film series. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While the franchise’s ninth movie,&nbsp;Spiral: From the Book of Saw hits theaters on May 14, 2021, Bell will not appear in the film. But the actor is not yet done with the franchise and hinted at his willingness to return for the role if the writing was great. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Bell As Jigsaw</h2><p>Bell started&nbsp;acting <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">professionally&nbsp;</a>in 1979 and has appeared in over 100 movies and TV series in his 30 plus year career. Out of all these works, his career-defining work is his role of Jigsaw in&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Saw.</p><p>The horror franchise established Bell as an iconic horror villain who tortured his victims physically and mentally. Jigsaw, whose actual name is John Kramer, becomes a cold killer after losing his unborn son and his marriage falling apart.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As he is slowly dying because of his metastatic colon cancer, he takes it upon himself to teach people the value of life, albeit with traps and choices laced with sadistic touches. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Bell’s Jigsaw was such a hit that despite being killed in&nbsp;Saw III, his character continued appearing in every movie in the horror franchise, usually through flashbacks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Bell Might Return As Jigsaw</h2><p>In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Comicbook.com</a>, Bell shared he would come back to the series if the writing was excellent.</p><p>It’s about the writing, if the writing is great… I can’t, frankly, prophesize about the future. You’ll have to wait and see.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The actor further shared that the opportunity to play Kramer in the franchise had been tremendous and that the character had a vast range, which could be made full use in future movies.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Spiral: From the Book of Saw</h2><p>Spiral: From the Book of Saw&nbsp;is the ninth movie in the&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;franchise. Initially, it was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">scheduled</a>&nbsp;to hit the theaters in the summer of 2020 but was delayed to May 14, 2021, because of the pandemic.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stars</a>&nbsp;of the movie are Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson. The film revolves around the two trying to catch a Jigsaw copycat going after members of the police department.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The villain in the movie seems to follow the style of Jigsaw, even emulating the usage of puppets to communicate with the victims. But unlike Billy the Puppet, the antagonist in Spiral is using a puppet with a pig head. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Tobin Bell's Net Worth</h2><p>Bell <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">decided </a>to become an&nbsp;actor at 22&nbsp;and learned his craft at the 'Actor’s Studio.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Throughout his long career, not only has he played parts in dozens of movies but also given his voice to characters in&nbsp;The Flash&nbsp;(2016-2017) and&nbsp;Boogeyman 3&nbsp;(2008).
