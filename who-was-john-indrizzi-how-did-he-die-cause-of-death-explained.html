The construction manager’s wife, Susan, and their three children survive him.&nbsp; The extraordinary death has surprised everyone, and individuals have been sending sympathy letters since the news surfaced.&nbsp;John was the CEO of the Perth-based construction business Exclusive Linings, which was engaged in multimillion-dollar projects such as the Adelaide Airport renovation and the building of a CBD skyscraper.</p><h2>How Did Australian Building Company Boss John Indrizzi Die?</h2><p><strong>John Indrizzi</strong>, the CEO of Perth-based construction firm Exclusive Linings, has died. His family verified the news and paid respect to Mr Indrizzi, calling him a ‘wonderful guy.’ They published a Facebook memorial in which hundreds of people remembered John as a ‘wonderful soul.’&nbsp;“He was loved by so many and will be missed more than he will ever know,” his daughter Josie said. “As a family, we will hold onto the good times tightly and keep them safe in our hearts,” she said.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Indrizzi-1.jpg alt="John Indrizzi" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to one close acquaintance, John was ‘like a brother’ with a ‘heart of gold.’ “He [John] fit two lifetimes into one,” said another buddy. tons and tons of lovely memories.” His family and friends have been devastated. “He will be missed forever, but never forgotten,” a buddy said. The 60 King William Project Team has set up a GoFundMe page to assist John’s family during this difficult time.

Bio & Wikipedia</h2><p><strong>John Indrizzi</strong> has been the managing director of Exclusive Linings for 12 years. The construction company specializes in creating interior walls and ceilings.&nbsp;The company was recently engaged in big projects such as the $ 450 million 60 King William Street office skyscraper in Adelaide’s CBD and the $ 165 million Adelaide Airport refurbishment.&nbsp;John married and had three children with Susan. Oliver is the boy, while Josie and Emilee are the girls. John was just 46 years old and at the pinnacle of his profession.</p><p>Another Australian construction tycoon died earlier this year. This year, John Indrizzi’s untimely death came on the heels of Metricon CEO Mario Baisin’s death in May, which shocked the Australian construction sector. His passing was also felt throughout the nation.&nbsp;Baisin, 71, co-founded the company in 1976 and helped it expand to become Australia’s biggest home builder. He was said to have had a number of mental health concerns.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Indrizzi-2.jpg alt="John Indrizzi" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>His death occurred only days before the Company entered crisis negotiations amid persistent rumors of financial troubles. It has, nevertheless, continued to function.&nbsp;Baisin’s death brought to mind his words in a May 2020 podcast, in which he disclosed the difficulties that the industry, in general, and Metricon in particular, had been facing for some time.&nbsp;“It’s been a rollercoaster ride, to say the least,” Metricon remarked at the time. He discussed the influence of Covid-19 all over the globe.</p><p>The construction sector has been shaken by a series of failures this year, with Tozer Construction Group being forced to liquidate by a court of law.&nbsp;These enterprises have been facing rising material and labor expenses in the face of declining sales, prompting a number of them to succumb and fail.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>John Indrizzi</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>John Indrizzi Death</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecmon6dlmaOxs7XZs6BmoJ%2BseqW1w2afnmWUnrJur8Cuqp5ln5t6pbHArZ9mnailuaK1zZ6baA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aaron-rodgers-talks-fatherhood-after-shailene-woodley-engagement.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aaron Rodgers Talks Fatherhood After Shailene Woodley Engagement</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./txunamy-dating-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Txunamy Dating?
