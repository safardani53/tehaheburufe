Beating the Tinseltown odds, LL has been married to his wife, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Simone South</strong></a>, for over 25 years! Find out all about their fairytale romance, below.</p><h2>LL & Simone’s Meet Cute</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Having one of the longest relationships in Hollywood begs the question “Where did it all start?”. LL and Simone met while they were teenagers in 1987. “I was just 19, something like that,” LL recalled to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> in 2012. “It was Easter and I was driving down the block in my mother’s car.” The star said he stopped to talk to a buddy when the buddy asked if LL wanted to meet his cousin, Simone. At first, LL was cool on the idea — but then he caught a glimpse of Simone. “I looked over and said ‘Oh yeah, I’ll meet your cousin.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>After eight years of dating, the couple made it official and got married in August 8, 1995. As for the reason behind their lasting union, Simone once dished to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong></a>, “Putting God first, we both come from a spiritual background. And compromise, a lot of compromise. Picking your battles; respecting each other.”</p><h2>Simone Is A Cancer Survivor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LL-Cool-J-Wife-25-Year-Marriage-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In 2004, Simone was diagnosed with stage 3 chondrosarcoma after discovering a knot in her leg. A 15-hour surgery and over two-year recovery process where she had to learn to walk again has Simone able to be cancer-free for over 14 years now. And LL was by her side the entire time. “You don’t abandon someone in that fox hole,” LL told Oprah about his dedication. “You gotta be there in that fox hole with them.” Now the couple help others battle the disease as supporters of&nbsp;the “Beat Cancer Like a Boss”&nbsp;campaign.</p><h2>Beyonce & Rihanna Are Fans Of Simone’s Jewelry Line</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Simone starting her own jewelry line after beating cancer. She teamed up with her pal <strong>Mary J Blige</strong> to make the line <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sister Love </a>and then began a separate line for Walmart called “Simone I. Smith for Walmart”. Beyonce, Cardi B and Rihanna have all been clients of Simone!
