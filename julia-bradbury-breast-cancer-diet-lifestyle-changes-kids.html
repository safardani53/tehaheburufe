When I’m filming, my rider is, ‘Please can I start at ten and can I eat my steamed vegetables at 11?’”</p><p>Julia is so passionate about clean eating that she’s banned cereal and plastic bottles from the house so the children have as few toxins in their diets as possible.</p><p>She says: “My kids raise their eyebrows at me when I go on about toxins in plastic and sugar in foods.</p><p>“We drink water from glass bottles, not plastic, because they’re full of <a href=#>hormone-mimicking chemicals</a>. And cereals are out.</p><p>“When it comes to pizza, we only have <a href=#>sourdough</a>. And if they’ve had pizza once that week, they can’t have it again.</p><p>“It shouldn’t be a go-to, everyday food. You’re eating wheat that’s mass produced and the emulsifiers, they’re bad.</p><p>“We’ve all become so addicted to pizza, bread, pasta, sugary sauces.</p><p>“I’m lucky that my kids love veggies like broccoli, sauerkraut and cauliflower, and will snack on cucumbers and carrots.</p><p>“If they get really hungry, shove that under their noses and they’ll get full and get used to it.”</p><p>Julia admits she’s seen raised eyebrows as a result of her children’s <a href=#>super-healthy diets</a>.</p><p>She says: “People say, ‘God, I feel sorry for your kids’, but really? Don’t.</p><p>“My kids understand why I feel this way. And, of course, they don’t think sweets equal <a href=#>cancer</a>. They know it’s coming from a good place.</p><p>“And more importantly, they understand about food. They know what proteins and carbs are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sun_Instagram_image_download_juliabradbury_153910jpg-JS844960871.jpg><p>“Even though I am a pain-in-the-arse mummy, these things will stick with them.</p><p>“I hope they won’t chow down on <a href=#>McDonald’s</a> when they go to uni, or slurp <a href=#>Coca-Cola</a> all the time, but they might.</p><p>“At some stage they’ll come back and they’ll know.”</p><p>Along with her diet, Julia has radically overhauled her sleep routine, leaving her busy social life a distant memory.</p><p>“It’s a rarity for me to go out and see my friends in the evening, or stay up past 10pm,” she says.</p><p>“I have a sleep hygiene routine. When I’ve not been sleeping properly for a couple of nights, my blood glucose goes up and it makes me feel really tired.</p><p>“When I know my body is tired, my responses aren’t going to be as good and I won’t digest my <a href=#>food</a> properly.</p><p>“My golden rule is to eat while it’s light, stop when it’s dark. It’s harder to digest food in the evening.”</p><p>But Julia is realistic that she can’t always run her life like clockwork.</p><p>“I did actually stay up until 1am the other night,” she says.</p><p>“I didn’t <a href=#>drink</a>, but I was dancing and chatting with my friends and there’s value to that, too.</p><p>“Fun, enjoyment, pleasure — it’s important for your health once in a while.</p><p>“But in today’s society, we are conditioned to think fun equals eating cake and drinking <a href=#>alcohol</a> — and it doesn’t have to.”</p><p>Julia, whose passion has always been the great outdoors, has detailed her lifestyle changes in her new book, Walk Yourself Happy, in which she encourages readers to look to the healing power of nature.</p><p>She credits getting outside, taking in oxygen from the trees and walking at least 10,000 steps a day with helping her survive cancer.</p><p>She also had a single <a href=#>mastectomy</a> in October 2021.</p><p>It’s something the star feels strongly about because, like many cancer survivors, there is always the fear it could return.</p><p>“I’ve discovered from <a href=#>DNA</a> testing that I have a higher chance of recurrence than other women in my position,” she explains.</p><p>“If there was another Julia next to me and she didn’t have the genetic make-up I have, she would have a ten per cent chance of recurrence, but I have a 13 per cent chance.</p><p>“I hope I’ve found a way of dealing with that.</p><p>“It’s very important to understand the trauma you go through with something like a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>“I’ve shed tears and I’ve felt very frightened pre-mastectomy. But I think I’ve learnt to comfortably live with it.</p><p>“Sometimes, I let it back into my life and I’ll have a teary meditation. And I practise gratitude, I’m doing well.”</p><p>As for the current state of play, Julia is pragmatic.</p><p>She says: “I’ve done an ultrasound and <a href=#>blood tests</a> quite recently and although my white blood count was a bit low, that could have been down to a variety of factors on the day, like tiredness.</p><p>“I’m in good health right now and I’m certainly doing all I can to stay that way.”</p><p>She also understands that some people may find her lifestyle overhaul a little extreme and she is conscious not to preach.</p><p>She says: “I get a lot of pushback from people on <a href=#>social media</a> when I talk about what I’ve changed.</p><p>“Some people say, ‘You’re blaming me for my illness. You’re saying it’s my fault’.</p><p>“I’m not saying that. You don’t know what all the things in our environment are doing to you.</p><p>“But don’t underestimate that there are things at play that will have an effect on your health.</p><p>“I can’t change the past. I ate the sugar. I stayed up late, I drank the way I did.</p><p>“Maybe it would’ve happened to me anyway, but I don’t blame myself or feel shame.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s one thing that contributes to <a href=#>chronic illness</a>. I think it’s a multitude of things.</p><p>“But one thing’s for sure, it’s never too late to make lifestyle changes that can have a positive impact on your health.”</p><ul><li><strong>Walk Yourself Happy by Julia Bradbury, £20, is out now.
