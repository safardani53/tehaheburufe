wrong side of.</p><p>Reputation was everything in the East End of London and Shaw learned the hard way that the only way to survive was to never back down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/former-convict-hugh-collins-kate-234303.jpg><h2>Who was Roy Shaw?</h2><p>Shaw was born in Stepney, East <a href=#>London</a>, on March 11, 1936, just before the outbreak of <a href=#>World War II</a> and was bullied as a child.</p><p>After the death of his father when he was only ten years old, Shaw finally snapped and fought back at the bullies.</p><p>"God has given me a gift" he recalls in his autobiography, Pretty Boy, and by 16 he was schoolboy <a href=#>boxing </a>champion, winning his first title at the <a href=#>Royal Albert Hall</a>.</p><p>He got his nickname "Pretty Boy" after a suggestion from a Sun journalist&nbsp;.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON HARDMEN">READ MORE ON HARDMEN</h2><p>Shaw's <a href=#>national service</a> was partly spent in Colchester army <a href=#>prison, </a>where he was incarcerated after attacking staff sergeants, and partly in a psychiatric hospital before being given a dishonourable discharge.</p><p>This began his brushes with the law and he was sent to Borstal for a violent robbery of a bookie.</p><p>He escaped there using the Borstal doctor's car and embarked on a brief boxing career where he was forced to fight under the name Roy West due to being on the run.</p><p>Any hopes of a career in the sport ended when he was rearrested and jailed for a further three years for his attack on the doctor whose car he stole to escape.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><h2>How did Roy Shaw die?</h2><p>Shaw who boxed under the nickname, "Mean Machine", had been in a home due to his poor health.</p><p>He finally passed away on July 14, 2012, from heart failure.</p><h2>Did Roy Shaw fight Lenny McLean?</h2><p>Roy Shaw had fought in a number of bare-knuckle fights and became known as the "unofficial heavyweight champ" and "the hardest man in Britain".</p><p><a href=#>Lenny McLean</a>, who had got himself the reputation as "the King of the cobbles" and thought himself to be the "Guv'nor" took offence to Shaw's claim.</p><p>This spurred a trilogy of fights between the pair.</p><p>In May 1977, Shaw beat McLean by TKO but the "Guv'nor" claimed his gloves had been tampered with and demanded a rematch.</p><p>The second fight, in April 1978, which again was held at Cinatra's Nightclub led to McLean being restrained by four heavies as he seemed to lose the plot.</p><p>McLean eventually won the vicious fight as he knocked Shaw through the ropes into the first row of the venue.</p><p>The final "straightener" between the pair was at the Rainbow Theatre in North London.</p><p>It ended with a McLean victory with him stood on the ropes screaming to the crowds "I am the Guv'nor!"</p><h2>Did Roy Shaw go to prison?</h2><p>In 1963, Shaw was part of a gang that robbed a security van in <a href=#>Kent</a>.</p><p>He was arrested weeks later and imprisoned for 18 years.</p><p>Shaw started his sentence at Wandsworth Prison where he was come across <a href=#>Ronnie Biggs</a>, the <a href=#>train robber,</a> before being moved to Parkhurst.</p><p>He had many violent clashes with authorities at the prison and was eventually sent to a psychiatric until at Grendon Underwood.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>His uncontrollable temper then led to him being shipped to Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital.</p><p>"Pretty Boy" Shaw was to serve at a number of prisons but on his release decided to turn his hand to bare-knuckle boxing which was to see him cross paths with Lenny McLean.</p><p class=postsid
