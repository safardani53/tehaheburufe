With this format, only the girls with actual events happening in their lives that are film-worthy will make the final cut," the tipster continues.</p><p>“The producers hope this will keep everything exciting for the fans, and also for the girls who are filming.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Yes, it’s possible that the cast will be further downsized as a cost-cutting measure.</p><p>But for now, the only two stars have been left out of the new show are Kailyn Lowry and Mackenzie McKee.</p><p>The Kail news isn’t terribly surprising.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For months now, <a href=#>Lowry has been threatening to quit</a> the show that made her famous, and she recently boasted that she makes more money from podcasting than from her appearances on MTV.</p><p>But it seems that Mackenzie was blindsided by the news that her services were no longer needed.</p><p>“Kail was asked but she turned the new show down,” a different production source tells The Ashley.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“But she was asked. Mackenzie was not asked. She was basically ghosted by MTV and [her producers] and was never actually told she was not invited to be on the show," the insider alleges.</p><p>"They just didn’t respond to her and left her hanging.”&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, Mackenzie got the rawest deal here (and since she was a late addition to Teen Mom OG, she’s probably not as financially comfortable as the other girls).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But it sounds like all of the moms will need to make lifestyle adjustments as a result of this latest shakeup.</p><p>“The cast only gets paid for the episodes they’re in. If their voice or image doesn’t appear in the episode, they are not paid, so with each episode only featuring select girls, this will be a real hack in their paycheck, especially to the girls who don’t really show much while filming,” says the second source.</p><p>The budgets for the current Teen Mom shows are much higher than those of most reality series, and the franchise’s ratings have been steadily declining for years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>You don’t need to be a seasoned network exec to know that that’s not a winning formula.</p><p>The Ashley‘s source revealed back in March that the spinoff represents the franchise’s last, best hope of remaining on the air in any form.</p><p>“This is like their last-ditch effort to keep the shows going…There are just too many people working on this franchise and it’s not bringing in the ratings and money it once did," an insider said at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"They needed to come up with a way to keep the show going but in a cheaper way. The casts’ salaries are enormous and it costs a lot of money to fly all over the country to film the girls.”&nbsp;</p><p>As for that corny title, The Ashley‘s source says it’s probably here to stay.</p><p>“That’s the working title,” the first source explains&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“It could change but they’re pretty set on that. They think the girls on this show have a ‘legacy’ because they’ve been on TV for so long.”&nbsp;</p><p>Will Legacy live up to its name and become MTV’s next long-running hit?</p><p>The odds seem slim — but given the size of their salaries, we’re not surprised that the eight remaining moms are willing to give this project a shot!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WCcMDEnqVmpZ%2BierS8yKemn55dqLKztcSsZJynnpu2s7nEnWSwoJ%2Boequ7yKegp59dqbWmecKaqq1lp528brPOrWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-charles-nude.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;It's a Beautiful Day Today&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mckayla-maroney-pics-hot-photos-olympic-gymnast.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>See Hot Photos Of The Olympic Gymnast Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
