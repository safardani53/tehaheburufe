Four months later, Us Weekly confirmed that the flirty pair were hooking up. “Things became <a href=#>official</a> over the past week while they were in New York City together,” a source explained at the time. “It’s so weird. Not just the age difference, but mostly the fact that Sofia had been a family friend for years, and was close to <a href=#><strong>Kendall</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie [Jenner]</strong></a>.”</p><p>Before heating things up with Richie, Disick was in a longtime on-off relationship with <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, with whom he shares children <a href=#>Mason, Penelope and Reign</a>. For years, fans watched the former pair’s drama play out on Keeping Up With the Kardashians until they called it quits once and for all in 2015 after nine years together. Despite her own ups and downs with her ex, the Poosh founder gave Richie her full stamp of approval.</p><p>“Kourtney thinks <a href=#>Sofia brings out the best in Scott</a> and is happy for them,” a source revealed in September 2019. “Kourtney and Sofia share a common background and lifestyle, and Sofia is easy to get along with and is a normal girl.”</p><p>Though they may have seemed like a perfect fit, Us confirmed that <a href=#>Disick and Richie called it quits</a> in May 2020 after the reality star’s brief stay in a Colorado rehab facility.</p><p>“Sofia and Scott breaking up was only a matter of time. Scott isn’t the best version of himself right now and it has been a lot for Sofia,” a source explained at the time. “[Sofia] is sad about the situation, but trying to take care of herself.”</p><p>Disick, for his part, was “feeling<a href=#> sad and defeated</a> in a way right now and upset about all the news surrounding his relationship before his split.”</p><p>In July 2020, the pair appeared to be back on yet again. However,&nbsp;<i>Us</i><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>confirmed in mid-August 2020 that the pair <a href=#>were on another break</a> and “spending time apart.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Disick moved on with model <a href=#><strong>Amelia Gray Hamlin</strong></a> in October 2020, when the pair were spotted at <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>’s birthday bash. They confirmed their romance the following February.</p><p>Scroll down to relive Disick and Richie’s romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKS7061knaGjnrCsecCnm2arn5u2onnRopqhoZViv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedOipJ6kmaOycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./spokesmaynes-girlfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Spokesmaynes Girlfriend: Who is Spokesmayne Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bbc-series-returning-between-the-covers-sara-cox.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Popular BBC series with celebrity host returning to screens for a seventh series</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
