car?</strong></h2><p>Many of the <a href=#>UK</a> parking rules are common sense, such as not parking too close to another driver.</p><p>The Highway Code says that anyone <a href=#>parking</a> on-street should park facing the direction the road travels, not against the flow of <a href=#>traffic</a>.</p><p>There is no minimum requirement that details how far away you need to park.</p><p>However, it's expected that drivers will offer other motorists the courtesy of having enough space to manoeuvre out safely.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On Motoring">Read More On Motoring</h2><p>The advice given is usually along the lines of 'tyres and tarmac' — which means you should be able to see the tyres and road beneath the car parked in front of you.</p><p>Sometimes, there are a lot of people parking on a small stretch of road, so distances will be tight, which is why there is a 'common sense' requirement as opposed to a legal one.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>In case of an emergency, you could contact the police and a car parked too closely as an obstruction if you cannot get out onto the road.</p><p>It goes without saying that you shouldn’t park too close to a vehicle that has a <a href=#>blue badge</a> disability permit showing for access reasons.</p><p>Make sure you apply the handbrake before you leave the car and switch the engine off so you don't cause any accidental collisions while you are gone.</p><h2><strong>What should I do if someone hits my parked car?</strong></h2><p>Coming back after running your errands and finding that someone has hit your parked car is infuriating.</p><p><a href=#>Government</a> advice says that if you are in an accident "causing damage or injury" you must give your name and address and the vehicle registration number to anyone with "reasonable grounds for requiring them", e.g. your insurance provider.</p><p>If the driver left a note or stuck around, you need to exchange insurance details, and they may even offer to pay for the damage on the spot.</p><p>Take some pictures of the damage for your records before contacting your insurers.</p><p>Make sure you report the accident to your insurance company even if you do not plan to make a claim.</p><p>If you do not own the vehicle you will need to give the owner's name and address.</p><p>You should report the accident to the <a href=#>police</a> within 24 hours if you do not give your details at the time of the incident.</p><p>Your insurance company will also be able to give you more advice specific to your situation.</p><h2><strong>What should I do if I hit someone's parked car?</strong></h2><p>If you collide with another vehicle, parked or otherwise, you should stay at the scene or make contact with the driver of the car you hit.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>If you can't wait around you should leave a note on their vehicle.</p><p>Failure to do so may result in a simple accident becoming categorised as a hit-and-run.</p><p class=postsid
