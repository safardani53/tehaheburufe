Her coworker, who was in the bathroom with her, then gestured toward the tights machine, which looked strikingly similar to a tampon machine, except with a slot for dollar bills.</p><p>As the video continued, @kenzjee put some cash into the slot and explained that each pair of tights costs $5. She then hit a button that was labeled "Suntan B" in small letters, and a pair of tights came out immediately.</p><p>There were also "Suntan C" and "Suntan D" options, which denote different skin tones.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Naturally, the comments were brimming with questions. "Is that in the normal bathroom?" one user asked. @kenzjee replied with an older video in which she explained that the tights machine is indeed located in the regular customer bathroom, which the employees also use. The machines are supposed to be just for the waitresses; however, she noted that customers do buy the tights on occasion, even though they're not supposed to.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Referencing the tights, another user wondered: "Is that tax-deductible as a work-related expense?"</p><p>@kenzjee replied that it is. She also explained that Hooters gets the tights from a third-party company, and can't provide employees with free tights because tights are considered "undergarments." Other users believed there was a way around that and said Hooters was just being "greedy." However, one TikToker compared the tights to the scrubs that medical workers must purchase.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hooters has previously faced criticism from employees about their uniforms on TikTok.</h2><p>While @kenzjee wasn't complaining about Hooters or the price of the tights in her TikTok (it was onlookers on the platform who expressed shock about the price and the machine), Hooters waitresses have used the video-sharing app in the past to voice workplace concerns.</p><p>In October 2021, many were upset after <a href=#>the company issued new shorts that were noticeably much shorter</a> than the previous uniform. TikTok creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@sick.abt.it</a> shared her thoughts in the viral video below and users quickly took her side in the comments.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Love my job but don't love wearing undies to work," she wrote alongside the video. Within a few days, the CEO of Hooters contacted the TikToker to inform her that she could wear her old uniform (read: longer, comfier shorts) to work again.</p><p>This goes to show that the comments users write on TikTok have power — even when users least expect it. Perhaps if enough people sound off in the comments on @kenzjee's post, Hooters might amend its tights policy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbywwMSrqmasmZy1tb%2BMraCkrJ%2Bg</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-william-prince-harrys-relationship-over-the-years-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Prince William, Prince Harrys Relationship Over the Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-wood-melissa-benoist-make-out-relationship-mexico-supergirl-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>[PICS] Chris Wood &amp;amp; Melissa Benoist Make Out In Mexico See Steamy Pics Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
