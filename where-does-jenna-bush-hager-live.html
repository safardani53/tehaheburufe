We have all the answers for you here!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where does Jenna Bush Hager live?</h2><p>The expertly designed Hager home is featured in the November/December issue of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Veranda</u><u> magazine</u></a>. According to the article written up about the home, it is a "sweet cottage on Long Island’s North Shore." So there you have it — Jenna Bush Hager and her family live on the North Shore!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>After purchasing this sweet cottage on Long Island's North Shore, @jennabhager enlisted the help of her former college roommate and designer @traciwhitedesigns to outfit the cottage. The pair quickly began looking through pieces from the Bush and Hager families. "Jenna inherited her mother's eye for design and is drawn to things with character and a history she can trace," says White. The broad entry hall with woodland covered walls (@scalamandre) connects two wings of the cottage. The floors are painted a fresh blue-green (Riverway by @sherwinwilliams) with a sage border (Saybrook Sage by @benjaminmoore). The painted chair in the corner of the hall was found by Jenna and her husband Henry as they were looking through the home's basement. | Photography by @taradonnephoto, produced by @rachaelburrow, styling by @francesfinds, and written by @ellenmcgauley, as seen in the November/December issue.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Veranda Magazine</a> (@verandamag) on Oct 29, 2019 at 9:30am PDT</p></figure><p>Jenna and her husband Henry weren’t actually looking to purchase a home in the area but had been renting summer homes there for a few years. When the adorable cottage came on the market, Jenna couldn’t help but stop in during the open house... and the rest is history. “There was something about it that reminded me of Texas, of being outside. Even this close to the city, there was a remoteness to it,” she said. After showing the house to her husband, the two agreed to make a purchase.</p><p>When the Hagers purchased the home, they enlisted the help of Jenna’s former college roommate Traci White, who is now an interior designer based in Dallas. The four-bedroom home is filled with a delightful mixture of fresh, bright colors, and charming vintage details. The rooms also feature several paintings by Jenna’s father, President George W. Bush.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>As someone who loves interior design, working with the loviest people at @verandamag to capture our house which means family and love was pretty cool.

She would teach my sister, Barbara, and me about birds, rocks, every constellation in the sky.”</p><p>After she and her husband looked at the cottage together for the first time, they went to a local café to talk things over. While they were there, an older gentleman approached their table and said he was familiar with the cottage. “They get the best birds,” he said. “It felt so serendipitous,” says Jenna.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Welcome to the world my darling Henry Harold “Hal” Hager!

Although the Long Island home necessitates a bit of a commute to the couple’s Manhattan jobs, they both feel the remote location is totally worth it.</p><p>Jenna has said that part of what drew them to their North Shore home was the fact that their kids could spend plenty of time outdoors. “You’re outdoors and you’re barefoot. It’s how Henry and I grew up, and it’s what we want for our children,” she said in the interview with Veranda. Sounds pretty idyllic, no?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6ido2K3prrNmmSbraOdeqmtxp6pZqSZq7I%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-manganiello-makes-red-carpet-debut-with-caitlin-oconnor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Manganiello Makes Red Carpet Debut With Caitlin OConnor Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shkelzen-gashi.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Shklzen Gashi net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
