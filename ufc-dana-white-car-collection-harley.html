But it's not just property White splashes his cash on.</p><p>Through the years, the boss of MMA has bought some of the world's most expensive and classy motors, bikes, and he only flies private.</p><p>Here's a guide to this boys' toys.</p><h2>MAKE MINE A HARLEY</h2><p>As one of UFC's proud sponsors, Harley Davidson were always going to look after bike-lover White.</p><p>And he has made no secret of his love for the legendary motorbike brand - seen on his reality TV show 'Dana White: Lookin' For A Fight' riding one in all its glory.</p><p>That was a gift from Harley Davidson in 2014 that features the UFC logo on the side, and comes with a starting price of £20,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582938649.jpg><h2>DUCATI AND AGUSTA</h2><p>After he got his first Harley Davidson, White began to become fascinated with motorbikes.</p><p>He soon invested in a stunning Ducati bike that also featured UFC insignia on its side, as well as a MV Agusta F4.</p><p>The latter, a limited edition model, is worth around £23,000, and has a top speed of 193mph.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000004621623.jpg><h2>MY FERRARI</h2><p>With a definite need for speed, White loves his cars to be as fast as his bikes.</p><p>And as a young man he dreamed of owning a Ferrari, and made a vow to himself if he struck it rich he would treat himself to one.</p><p>His first was a classic red Ferrari Testarossa, as made famous by Tom Selleck in Magnum P.I.</p><p>In 1989, when it was first released, it cost a staggering £180,000.</p><p>White also added a black Ferrari Spider F430 to his collection that cost around £210,000.</p><p>Underneath its bonnet, is a 4.3 L V8 engine that's capable of powering the F430 from 0-60mph in just 3.6 seconds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493404581-e1589549295103.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582935430.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582934036.jpg><h2>HIS FIRST CAR</h2><p>“My first car was my worst car. It was rusted out Datsun B210”, White told Dubmagazine.com.</p><p>He also revealed how the muffler continually fell off the exhaust and the sound it would make would be excruciating.</p><p>Today, the Datsun B210 is considered a vintage motor - and somewhat of a collector's item.</p><p>However, it reminds White of where he was when he first bought it - not living the high-life he's since become accustomed to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582941820-1.jpg><h2>THE MUSCLE CAR</h2><p>Every proud American wants to own a muscle car, and White is no exception.</p><p>So when US reality TV show MuscleCar offered to make him a 1971 Plymouth Barracuda, he was happy to accept.</p><p>It's one of his prized possessions, and he and UFC commentator Joe Rogan both have one.</p><p>Aesthetically pleasing, it's not as quick as his bikes or Ferraris.</p><p>It goes 0-60mph in 5.8 seconds, and has a top speed of 155mph.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582941435.jpg><h2>WHEN KHABIB COPIED HIM</h2><p>In terms of a luxury ride, White's favoured choice is a BMW M6 Gran Coupe, which has a starting price of around £115,000.</p><p>Often, he's driving it to events and parking it in the car for UFC's talent, however that can also backfire.</p><p>Cheeky <a href=#>Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> once gave the motor a makeover by adding a fur hat to its bonnet.</p><p>But White had the last laugh, mind. Khabib was actually quite enamoured by White's BMW and bought the same one for himself months later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582934034-e1589549734916.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582933730-1.jpg><h2>SWEET SIXTEEN</h2><p>Being a motor aficionado, and incredibly generous, White is adamant his sons should have nice rides too.</p><p>And when they turned 16, he gave them the keys to these glorious machines.</p><p>He bought eldest son Aidan a customised, tripped out Defender Works V8 70th Anniversary Edition for around £180,000, a collector's item with just 150 made.</p><p>Then, when Dana Jr celebrated his milestone birthday he was treated by his dad to a BMW M6 with a price tag of around £125,000.</p><p>The BMW M6 is capable of reaching 0-60mph in 4.2 seconds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582938646.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000582935901-1.jpg><h2>JET-SET</h2><p>When you're boss of a billion-dollar franchise, the only way to fly is private.</p><p>That's why whenever White is on business, he takes his Bombardier jet on his travels with him.</p><p>Ranging from £3million to £90million, it's the ultimate indulgence, but you better be careful who you travel with.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in MMA</h2></p><p>Once, <a href=#>White invited one of his heroes Mike Tyson</a> on board, and the pair got into a hilarious prank that went viral.</p><p>Tyson tapped White on the shoulder, telling him to give up his seat so he could sit down.</p><p>Of course, White duly obliged and told the former heavyweight champ to enjoy his luxury flight. Later Tyson scrawled 'd***' for kicks on White's forehead during the flight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000380861630.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000583170588.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lKBzH_zt7qYBjuE5JP0taNXt4vkmoFDe00Iai5e2Hgw.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mike Tyson slaps Dana White and kicks him out of his seat on private jet leaving UFC boss stunned in prank</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLqurY5qaG9rYGyFdHvUn5pmnJGjrm7Dx6KrnmWTlr9ur86lo56bpJ68r3nHmqmlnalk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nick-kocher.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Nick Kocher net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./woman-48-murdered-sheffield-fatal-head-injuries.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Woman, 48, found murdered in Sheffield house suffered fatal head injuries, cops say</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
