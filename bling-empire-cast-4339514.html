There’s just something so addicting about a reality series that delves into the extravagant lives of wealthy Asian and Asian-American socialites&nbsp;living it up in LA — don’t you think? While the latter is a more tamed definition, the 8-episode series is a rollercoaster of glamorous drama, mixed with lavish parties and designer everything. Think Crazy Rich Asians, but real-life, set in LA!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The witty cast is made up of 12 powerhouse individuals, whose occupations include a model, plastic surgeon, DJ, real estate developer and more.&nbsp;After the debut season of Bling Empire,&nbsp;the excentric and outspoken cast&nbsp;had us all begging for more.

He was born in South Korea, but was adopted and raised in Philadelphia. Kevin, who viewers watched explore his culture in season 1, is making moves — literally. He officially moved into his own place!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“It’s only like 500 square feet but it feels like a mansion to me,” he said in a “Where Are They Now” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a>, which was released by Netflix on January 25. Kevin, who’s the only cast member on the show who isn’t a millionaire, added that his new place “all included [is] about $1700.”</p><h2><strong>Kane Lim</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kane-lim-bling-empire-where-are-they-now-shutterstock-netflix-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>Kane Lim</strong> is a real estate developer and investor from Singapore, who LOVES to shop. &nbsp;Today, he continues to work at both while maintaining his fierce fashion — of course. He even has his own clothing line!&nbsp;Another thing he’s maintained is his friendship with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Anna Shay</strong></a>. In the Netflix video,&nbsp;Kane admitted that while the pandemic halted everyone’s shopping, he spent time with Anna, who was able to help.&nbsp;“During Covid, there was no shopping, no nothing,” he said. “Having a friend like Anna? Nothing’s shut down.” Kane added that the pair have been shopping together lately!</p><h2><strong>Anna Shay</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anna-shay-bling-empire-where-are-they-now-netflix-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Anna is a part-Japanese, part-Russian socialite, whose wealth stems from selling her father’s company Pacific Architects and Engineers.

And, if having a lavish life and flaunting it on Instagram was a sport, she’d be the winner of it all. Though, Christine takes her charitable and philanthropic work very seriously and continues to give back. Additionally, she’s also become quite close with Cherie.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Cherie has become a really good friend of mine,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oprah Magazine</a> after Bling Empire premiered on Netflix in mid-January. “We are plotting the marriage of our children.”&nbsp;Christine also noted that she may consider expanding her family. “I’ve gotten a ton of solicitations to be our surrogate. So, we may have to reopen that discussion,” she said.</p><h2><strong>Gabriel Chiu</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gabriel-chiu-bling-empire-where-are-they-now-shutterstock-netflix-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>It’s business as usual for Dr. <strong>Gabriel Chiu</strong>, one of the most prestigious&nbsp;plastic surgeons in LA, known for his immaculate work.

She was dating&nbsp;<strong>Andrew Gray</strong>&nbsp;in season 1, which chronicled their tumultuous relationship and its many highs and lows. After the two briefly split, they’re <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>back together</a> and are&nbsp;taking things slow.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“With Andrew’s behavior, I don’t excuse it at all,” she said in the Netflix video, referencing his actions in season 1. “I think it’s 100 percent wrong.”&nbsp;Those who’ve watched Bling Empire will know that [spoilers ahead!] the couple hit a rough patch during a trip to Paris in 2018 — when Andrew became angry with Kelly after she left him behind at a hotel. He ended up calling&nbsp;and texting&nbsp;Kelly and yelling at her over the phone, which caused fans and friends to express concern over his actions. The pair ultimately split and Kelly asked Andrew to move out of their home.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“[Fans] saw a really dark period of our relationship,” Kelly continued in the video. “After filming we took a good five-month or six-month break where we just focused on ourselves,” she said, explaining that they’re both attending individual therapy to learn more about themselves. Kelly went on to describe their relationship from then to now as being like “night and day.”</p><h2><strong>Andrew Gray</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/andrew-gray-bling-empire-where-are-they-now-shutterstock-netflix-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Andrew is a model and an actor, who’s best known for playing the Red Ranger in the 2013 show Power Rangers Megaforce&nbsp;Wild, right?
