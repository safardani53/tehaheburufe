A day later <a href=#>Schofield</a>, 61, issued a statement aimed at healing the rift, saying “<a href=#>the last few weeks have not been easy for either of us</a>”.</p><p>He added: “Whatever happens we still have each other to count on.”</p><p>Yet last night that claim seemed a distant hope — as Schofield faced being cast into the wilderness, and was .</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON PHILLIP SCHOFIELD">READ MORE ON PHILLIP SCHOFIELD</h2><p>An industry source said: “This appears to be the final curtain for Phil — and his latest move appears like career suicide.
