And as Chris revealed tonight, he has opened up.</p><p>Speaking for the first time about the album, the singer said: “Some of it is very ­personal, about real things in my life, and some is about things I see or we see, and some of it’s about trying to empathise with what ­others are going through.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000526346671-e1571946320542.jpg><p>In Arabesque, in lyrics that appear to be about his romance with Dakota, he sings: “I could be you, you could be me. Two raindrops in the same sea.</p><p>“You could be me, I could be you. Two angles of the same view.”</p><p>Tellingly, the second verse is in French — in which Dakota is fluent — hinting the track is a love letter to his girlfriend after they reignited their romance following a <a href=#>rough patch early this year</a>. It translates loosely as: “Like two streams, who gather, to make big rivers.”</p><p>And as <a href=#>Chris</a> added in an interview with Radio 1’s Annie Mac, he no longer worries what people think about what he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000404935036-e1571946416558.jpg><p>He explained: “There was something about our last tour that made me at peace with speaking openly and not minding if people disagree. You can just speak ­completely freely and let all the colours of life come through.”</p><p>Second track Orphans sees <a href=#>Chris</a> tackling the Syrian crisis in moving lyrics about a young woman living in the heart of a war zone.</p><p>It’s a moving and emotive subject but set to an upbeat backdrop that includes black observations where he imagines himself in the chaos.</p><p>He explains: “One of the things that might help people have a better time is to put themselves in other people’s shoes, whether that’s these kids who have to leave Syria, or who grew up in Baltimore, or whatever it might be. Rather than judging from afar, maybe to think: ‘I wonder what it’s like to be there’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NINTCHDBPICT000533766431.jpg><p>In a quirky move, the band unveiled the track listing today in classified adverts in local newspapers near to where they each grew up.</p><p>Sitting alongside notices for second-hand fridge freezers and car boot sales, their ads confirm the record is split into two halves titled Sunrise and Sunset.</p><p>Despite this, there’s nothing bargain basement about this sophisticated and insightful new release.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">bizbits</h3></p><ul><li>Jess Impiazzi says her old Celebrity Big Brother co-star Amanda Barrie gave her the confidence to return to acting as she prepares to appear in The Seven, alongside ex-Superman Dean Cain. Jess said: “To come back to acting is all I wanted.”</li><li>Post Malone leads the nominations at the American Music Awards with seven nods.
