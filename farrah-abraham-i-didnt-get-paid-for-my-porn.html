She’s apparently having issues with the porn company that employed her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So much so that Farrah is suing them for thousands of dollars that she says that they owe her. This is gonna be fun.</p><p>You know in sitcoms or romantic comedies or whatever when there’s a male character who’s hooking up with two women and he knows that he has to choose … but waits too long and ends up losing them both?</p><p>Well, that appears to be what happened with Farrah Abraham.</p><p>But instead of losing two lovers, she maybe lost two different sources of income. Two jobs.</p><p>Whatever happened with MTV — because there’s still a lot that’s unclear, especially after <a href=#>Farrah Abraham said that she wasn’t fired</a> — Farrah appears to be in hot water.</p><p>Allegedly, this is over her sex work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On the one hand, obviously, sex work is a valid form of employment and sex workers don’t deserve the kind of stigma that they receive.</p><p>(Though it’s possible that sex workers don’t really want Farrah Abraham working as their champion, because of her … personality issues)</p><p>On the other hand, if Farrah’s sex work is a clear violation of her contract with MTV, then that’s another matter.</p><p>Plenty of jobs have exclusivity clauses — though reality stars tend to get money from multiple sources, capitalizing on their fame.</p><p>Plenty of jobs have "morality" clauses, which tend to have less to do with actual right and wrong and more to do with things that they worry will make them look bad.</p><p>Something like that could be at play, here.</p><p>But questioning the grounds on which Farrah Abraham — the how of it all — might be less important than the why.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Does MTV really get its garters in a twist over sex work? Farrah’s brand of sex work is completely legal.</p><p>When <a href=#>Farrah Abraham strips down and masturbates on camera</a>, the only "bad" thing about the livestream is that Farrah’s involved. Oh, and that the livestream might crash due to high demand.</p><p>(Yes, really)</p><p>The thing is that it sounds like the sex work, if it was even a real factor, might just be an excuse.</p><p><a href=#>A lot of people don’t like Farrah&nbsp;Abraham</a>, and Farrah’s various Teen Mom costars may have banded together to get her booted off of the show.</p><p>That sounds awfully believable, though we wish that the impetus were one of <a href=#>Farrah’s racist rants</a>, which are actual bad things.</p><p>If Farrah really is losing her Teen Mom job because of sex work, that’s extra bad, because things between her and CamSoda right now are … not good.</p><p>RadarOnline reports that <a href=#>Farrah Abraham is suing CamSoda</a>, the company for which she previously livestreamed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She is suing the company for $5,000, which Farrah says that they have wrongly withheld.</p><p>Farrah’s legal team’s letter to the porn company contains details.</p><p>"Ms. Abraham was to be paid a total of ten thousand dollars; half due within two business days of signing the Agreement, and the remainder due following the completion of the Session."</p><p>First of all, 10 grand is a lot more than most camgirls make, but most camgirls aren’t celebrities.</p><p>"Ms. Abraham fulfilled her obligations under the contract, but despite this, CamSoda is willfully withholding the remaining $5,000 due under the Agreement, thereby constituting a material breach of contract."</p><p>According to the letter, CamSoda’s issue is that Farrah&nbsp;wasn’t wearing CamSoda merch … and said less than nice things about the company on social media.</p><p>"[Abraham] did not disrobe during the session; and allegedly disparaged CamSoda on social media."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We can see how both of those wouldn’t sit right with CamSoda.</p><p>"With respect to not disrobing, there is no requirement under the Agreement for Ms. Abraham to disrobe or be fully nude."</p><p>That’s a surprise. You might want to include that in writing next time, CamSoda.</p><p>"To the contrary, the Agreement specifically states that ‘Performer shall interact with and respond to various users during the Session as Company and Performer may agree.’ Ms. Abraham complied with this obligation and it was CamSoda who unilaterally decided to cut the Session short."</p><p>So … Farrah started a livestream but didn’t get a chance to get into it, then the bosses cut things short, and then Farrah said some unkind things about the company — allegedly. That’s the issue, right?</p><p>The letter goes on to say that CamSoda needs to cough up that 5 grand, or Farrah will seek damages and compensation for legal fees to the tune of $75,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It sounds like two things are going on here.</p><p>One, Farrah — like with MTV — voiced her criticism of a company employing her and didn’t except any consequences. Don’t do that, folks.</p><p>Two, it sounds like CamSoda&nbsp;is having buyer’s remorse when it comes to Farrah.</p><p>Our thoughts? Unless Farrah really did violate their agreement, it sounds like CamSoda might owe her a little cash. Maybe they should just pay her … and then not hire her again, now that they know what she’s like to work with.</p><p>In the mean time, we’ll keep trying to figure out if she’s actually been fired from Teen Mom OG or if she’s just … being Farrah.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Farrah Abraham: Was She Really Fired From Teen Mom OG?
