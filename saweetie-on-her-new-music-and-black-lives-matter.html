Like a mental health tap in. So I feel the song is fun, but has an underlying message of just tapping into different things, whether it’s social issues, your homegirls, fashion, all of the above.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Saweetie-on-Her-New-Summer-Anthem-and-Supporting-Black-Lives-Matter.jpg><p>The single is off her upcoming album, Pretty Bitch Music, with the “My Type” singer noting that the usage of “bitch” in the title as an acronym: Bossy, Independent, Tough, Creative, Hyphy —which Saweetie says was inspired by Tupac. The word “pretty” also has its own voice, with Saweetie explaining, “Pretty is like, what is your pretty? How does it make you feel? Because the social media standard of being a bad bitch or being pretty, it doesn’t fit everybody,” she said. “My fans come in all shapes, sizes, skin tones, backgrounds. I want them to all feel bomb as f–k. Because when they do listen to my music, I make them feel like a bad bitch.”</p><p>And if “Tap In” sounds familiar to hip-hop fans, you’re not mistaken. The “Up Now” singer sampled Too Short’s Bay Area 2006 classic, “Blow the Whistle.” “I’m happy that I got his blessing because he from the Bay, I’m from the Bay,” Saweetie told Us. “And the fact that I’m able to put my own twist on it and make it modern for my generation and Generation Z and everybody else, I think it’s a cool moment for hip hop history.”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Saweetie-on-Her-New-Summer-Anthem-and-Supporting-Black-Lives-Matter-Tap-In.jpg alt="Saweetie on Her New Summer Anthem and Supporting Black Lives Matter Tap in" width=1000 height=1000 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Something else the “Focus” rapper is doing for her generation is a call to action to support Black Lives Matter. As someone who grew up with a black father, uncles and grandfather whom she has witnessed be racially profiled throughout her life, Saweetie talks about the importance of this generation coming together to create change. “I just feel like it’s my duty, along with my peers, to kind of harness the younger generation because if we’re not educated — which I wasn’t as a kid — to vote, we feel like our opinion doesn’t matter when, in all actuality, it does,” she urged. “My whole thing is just educating my generation, the younger generation to let them know that their opinion and their voice matters. So when it comes time in November, it is our duty to go out there and vote.”</p><p>The rapper — whose <a href=#>At Home With Saweetie and PrettyLittleThing collaboration</a> is donating 100 percent of all profits to Black Lives Matter — finds inspiration for being a voice for her fans through her grandmother. “I like to know someone who has been a part of this movement since my age,” the “Tip Toes” singer told Us. “She’s been doing this since even younger than me. She’s very devoted to making a change in the black community. So that’s somebody who I talk to on the phone almost every morning and throughout the day. She kind of keeps me informed on what’s happening.”</p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Along with urging schools to highlight black history in textbooks, Saweetie also spoke her mind on the recent <a href=#>controversy surrounding <strong>Hannah</strong> <strong>Brown</strong></a>. “I feel like if you’re not black, period, you shouldn’t be saying it,” she told Us. “So whether if you’re white or something else, if you’re not black, don’t say the N-word. And that’s all I got to say to that.”</p><p>Saweetie fans stand up because there is much more to come from this hitmaker as she tells Us, “I’m here for a long time and a good time. So, I’m excited to see what the years are to come.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmqaeUmK60wNJon6isXZ28rbjYsKaonF%2BorrixxK2gnmWfo3qpsdFmpZ6vXaLCtLXCZpinnF2XuaKvymajoq6VqHqurdOtnKtn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-wonderstruck-commercial-the-journey-begins.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Wonderstruck Commercial: The Journey Begins</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gutta100-c3ht-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gutta100 (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
