She should know. In 1995, after an eight-year run as Stephanie Tanner on the ABC hit, she spiraled into a cycle of drug abuse, including ecstasy and crystal meth. And despite having daughter Zoie in 2008 and proclaiming to People and Good Morning America that she was sober, the two-time divorcee continued to snort cocaine — and, one reckless night, drove drunk with her baby. Now 27 and clean, Sweetin discusses the book’s bombshells with <a href=#>Usmagazine.com</a>.</p><p><strong>No. 1: Sweetin got so drunk at costar Candace Cameron’s wedding in 1996, she vomited and had to be carried out.</strong></p><p>“I probably had two bottles of wine, and I was only 14. That first drink gave me the self confidence I had been searching for my whole life. But that set the pattern of the kind of drinking that I would do.”</p><p><strong>No. 2: Sweetin graduated to ecstasy in high school and cocaine in college.</strong></p><p>“I wanted to prove that I could get more trashed than anyone. There were times I did so much coke, I’d be there laying there, getting sick and thinking ‘I’m going to die.’ But I didn’t care.”</p><p><strong>No. 3: During the premiere for Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s 2004 movie New York Minute, she walked the red carpet “high as a kite” and snorted meth in a bathroom stall.</strong></p><p>“I was pulling off the deceit. It was hard for people to believe I was doing that much drugs. I look at photos from that event, and I didn’t even look strung out!”</p><p><strong>No. 4: When she was 9 months old, Sweetin was adopted. She later learned her biological mom also abused drugs and her dad was killed in a prison riot.</strong></p><p>“I would hear stories about my mom leaving me to go off and party. And for years I was like, ‘F*** her. How could somebody do that to their kid?’ When I started seeing my own addiction getting in the way of being a mom, I finally understood: If you’re not in the right place to get sober, you’re not ready to be a mom.”</p><p><strong>No. 5: Though she bragged about her sobriety to Good Morning America and People in June 2008, she was secretly still getting high.</strong></p><p>“I was selfish, self-serving, insecure, angry and fearful person living a double life. I covered up my problems by pretending to be happy and saying that everything was fine.”</p><p>See today’s top star photos</p><p><strong>No. 6: She drove drunk with her baby daughter.</strong></p><p>“That was the big rock bottom. I had two glasses of wine and drove with her in the car. I not only put myself in danger, but also my daughter, who I loved more than anything. I felt terrible.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>No. 7: She’s still battling with second husband Cody Herpin for shared custody of Zoie.</strong></p><p>“I got sober for good on December 7, 2008. I was flying to L.A. and I ended up taking a bunch of Nyquil and drinking a s—load. When I got home, I got a call that there was an emergency custody investigation because of my drinking. From that day forward, I threw myself into going to AA and avoided people who do blow off their coffee tables. We’re working on a custody agreement right now. But life is good. I’m happier than I can remember.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5SeerTDxJ6roqZdZ31xhZFsaGln</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-meredith-mickelson-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Meredith Mickelson Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./skyler-woodward.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Skyler Woodward net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
