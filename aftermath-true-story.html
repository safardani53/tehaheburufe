Kevin and Natalie then learn that a Facebook post had indicated that their address was used to recruit white supremacists.</p><p>Finally, a man shows up to the home thinking that Natalie had posted an ad about wanting to have an affair with a stranger. The two have a violent tussle before Natalie stabs the intruder in the back with a pair of scissors.</p><p>When Natalie and Kevin go to the police station, they find out that Jay's brother-in-law, Robert Sorrentino (Alexander Bedria), has been arrested for posting the listings that caused the vandalism and the attack on Natalie.</p><p>He wanted the two to be scared off because he felt like they purchased the house for too low of a price.</p><p>Robert's desire to get the couple out is based on what happened to Jerry Rice and Janice Ruhter. The pair bought a home in San Diego, Calif. in 2011, while Janice was pregnant with their second child.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Many unnerving things began happening soon after they moved in.</p><p>They noticed that their home was still listed for sale online, and that they were getting charges on their bank statements that weren't theirs. Someone also posted an online party invite that encouraged people to go to their address without their knowledge.</p><p>The two began receiving magazine subscriptions before their mail was stopped entirely, and a listing was posted that advertised for an affair with Janice.</p><p>Like the duo in the film, Jerry and Janice set up surveillance in their home to catch the stalker. They found out that Kathy Rowe, who had also bid on the house, was the person behind all of the unsettling ads.</p><p>Though the motive behind the harassment was different in the film, Robert's actions are inspired by Kathy Rowe.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Janice Ruhter and Jerry Rice learned that Kathy Rowe was behind the harassment at their San Diego home.</h2><p>When Janice and Jerry first moved in, Kathy sent a note offering the couple an extra $100,000 on top of the asking price to move out of the home. They didn't respond, and that's when she began her harassment against them.</p><p>She felt like the one-story property was her dream home, and that it would offer her family a new lease on life. At the time, Kathy Rowe was caring for her severely disabled teenage daughter, and her husband had been battling cancer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Though Kevin and Natalie also have to deal with someone secretly living in their home in addition to Robert's actions in Aftermath, that was not based on what Jerry and Janice went through.</p><p>In November 2014, the San Diego resident pled guilty to felony stalking and she had to apologize to the couple she harassed. She was sentenced to one year of home electronic surveillance, and to five years of probation.</p><p>Kathy Rowe was also ordered to stay away from the married pair for 10 years.</p><p>Aftermath is available to stream on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrO1sdGmmK2gXam%2FtrGMrKuoqqk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bruno-sammartino-dies-wwe-legend-was-82.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bruno Sammartino Dies; WWE Legend Was 82</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sun-cream-fail-uva-nhs-minimum-protection-warning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Urgent warning as 4 top sun cream brands FAIL to meet NHS safety standards putting you at risk</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
