But, as it turns out, Williams is almost 1.65 meters tall.</p><p>Williams has brown eyes that go hand in hand with her brown hair, an oblong face, thin lips, and a perfectly dimpled cheek complimenting her captivating beauty.</p><p>Her work ethic and determination have been consistent for over a decade.</p><p>Similarly, Allison’s effort is praiseworthy, for no one should lightly assume that being a reporter is easy.</p><p>The Ann Harbor native possesses a very enticing body and comfortably makes the list of attractive sideline journalists.</p><h2>Sideline Reporter</h2><p>Allison pursued her dream of becoming a Journalist after completing college.</p><p>CSS immediately hired her as a high-spirited graduate to cover college-level basketball and football matches.</p><p>Gradually, Williams’ natural hosting ability led the network to assign her as an anchor for a segment called Ultimate Fan Experience.</p><p>The Michiganites traveled to Florida to work for FOX Sports after the CSS contract ended in 2010.</p><p>At the same time, upon arrival at FOX Sports and discussing service terms, the network decided to enlist Allison as a sideline reporter and a pregame show host.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Allison-Williams-Interviewing-Devin-Vassel.jpg><p>Besides, she covered the Florida Panthers <a href=# rel=noopener>hockey team</a> and the Florida Marlins baseball on home games with play-by-play man Steve Goldstein, color analyst Bill Lindsay, and sportscaster Frank Forte.</p><p>FOX Sports gave more opportunities to Williams, as she got to host a show called Miccosukee Sports Rap.</p><p>Eventually, the Miami Dolphins acquired her as a team member to report on their games and anchor Dolphins Game Day Live.</p><p>With sufficient experience, the sportscaster ventured into radio, wherein the Michigan-born undertook the hosting roles for Radio 560 WQAM for a year.</p><h3>ESPN</h3><p>Thus, with lots to give and a lot to prove, Williams applied for a post at ESPN.</p><p>The network accepted her request, and as of March 2011, Allison proudly reported for the said network.</p><p>In the same way, working at ESPN brought the limelight that the sportscaster never thought possible.</p><p>The broadcasting company entrusted her to handle the Big Monday segment’s hosting duties that widely covered college games.</p><p>In 2016, Allison moved from the Friday ESPN Night college football game to the Saturday slots on ABC/ESPN.</p><p>She worked with analysts<a href=# rel=noopener> Brock Huard</a> and commentator Bob Wischausen.</p><p>After fulfilling the roles designated to her, Allison found another segment to be a part of; The Jason Taylor Celebrity Golf Special.
