Its stars have amassed individual net worths beyond many viewers' wildest imaginations and <a href=#>Christine Chiu</a> is no different.</p><p>But what is Christine Chiu's net worth? She, along with her co-stars, has made a name for herself both on and off reality television and it's hard not to admire her hard work.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While her husband is the plastic surgeon in the family, Christine still lays claim to the business, as she is a big part of it. And, probably thanks to Bling Empire, her career has continued to grow in varying ways.</p><p>Not only does Christine already have an impressive net worth because of hers and her husband's careers, but she was in Season 30 of Dancing With the Stars and she's a New York Fashion Week trendsetter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Christine Chiu's net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Christine has a net worth of $50 million. Elsewhere on the website, it says her husband Gabriel Chiu's net worth is also $50 million. If those are separate findings, then they have quite a bit of wealth between them.</p><p>Christine is the managing director at Gabriel's plastic surgery clinic, so it makes sense that together, they are such a powerhouse. But it's still a surprisingly large number for fans.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Christine Chiu</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Reality TV Star</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $50 million</p><p>Christine Chiu is a reality TV star and philanthropist.

Of course that's just speculation, but Christine is definitely memorable among her co-stars. And for good reason.</p><p>In June 2022, Christine spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tatler</a> about her reality TV fame and what she hopes to do with it.</p><p>"I guess I just don't spend time thinking about recognition or fame," she told the outlet. "Rather, I'm focused on what we can accomplish next. My eye is on the prize of utilizing this platform and doing greater things."</p><p>She added that it's "humbling" to be part of Bling Empire and a "widening of inclusivity and diversity."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christine Chiu's husband has an important job on 'Bling Empire.'</h2><p>While Christine works to use her 15 minutes of fame for good while working with her husband and widening her philanthropic efforts, Gabriel keeps plenty busy himself. He owns Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc. and he has spent decades in the business.</p><p>Christine and Gabriel are known supporters of organizations like Children Mending Hearts and The Music Center and Ghetto Film School.</p><p>They also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">founded</a> The Prince's Foundation Chiu Integrated Health Programme in Scotland.
