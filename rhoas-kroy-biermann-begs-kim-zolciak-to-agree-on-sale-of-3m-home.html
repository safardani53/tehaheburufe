Bergstrom</strong> tells Us Weekly. The exes — who are <a href=#>in the middle of a messy divorce</a> — are more than $1 million in debt. One way to clear that debt, Bergstrom says, is if they sell their Atlanta-area home.</p><p>Biermann, who filed for divorce from Zolciak-Biermann in May and then again in August following a brief reconciliation, <a href=#>requested an emergency hearing last month</a> to ensure the residence is put on the market ASAP.</p><p>“If the court orders it then the court can enforce the order. It is taking control out of the hands of the parties,” Bergstrom told Us at the time. “And this is exactly what needs to be done at this point.”</p><p>One day later, however, Zolciak-Biermann told TMZ that the decision to put their house on the market was “mutual,” emphasizing that she “told him what to do.”</p><p>The pair — who share four minor children — previously faced foreclosure in February, though the auction was called off one month later. Biermann, who also adopted Zolciak-Biermann’s daughters following their 2011 nuptials, and Zolciak-Biermann are once again facing potential foreclosure in the face of financial difficulty. In May, TMZ reported that the former couple owe $1.1 million in unpaid taxes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kroy-Biermann-Begs-Kim-Zolciak-to-Agree-on-Sale-of-Their-Home-337.jpg><p>“The financial burdens have been a strain on their relationship,” a source exclusively told Us at the time. “Between the tax debt and other financial stresses, it’s been difficult. The tax debt was the straw that broke the camel’s back in their marriage.”</p><p>In August, lawyer <strong>Neama Rahmani</strong>, who is not working with Biermann or Zolciak-Biermann on their divorce, exclusively told Us that <a href=#>he is shocked that the duo haven’t filed for bankruptcy</a> yet.</p><p>“I’m really surprised at how they’ve handled this, both in terms of the family side and the potential bankruptcy,” he told Us. “It seems like these two need to separate, need to file for bankruptcy, really start their life over — both their personal and professional life, because everything just seems like a mess right now.”</p><p>Zolciak-Biermann and Biermann initially filed for divorce in May, with the athlete requesting full legal custody and physical custody of their four youngest kids. Their split only grew even more contentious in the following weeks. Zolciak-Biermann <a href=#>requested that Biermann get drug-tested</a> and Biermann filed paperwork to have the former Bravo personality <a href=#>psychologically evaluated</a>. Biermann even accused Zolciak-Biermann’s friend of kidnapping their eldest son, 12-year-old KJ, for taking him to a rodeo.</p><p>Then, in July, the pair briefly reconciled. “They’re getting along, so [Kim] called it off,” a source exclusively told Us at the time. “Tomorrow might be different.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One month later, Biermann filed for divorce for a second time.</p><p>“People knew it wouldn’t last,” a second insider exclusively told Us. “In the end, it was all about fights and finances.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BWwG630aiwZpqZmr%2Burc2nZJudl6h6rLXMZrGopJOerqx506hkmp%2BimrJuu81mqpqklWK8p3mSpmShp52afA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hottest-manchester-united-players-photos-soccer-fc-team.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See Pics Of The Soccer Hunks Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-bridgerton-sex-scene-instagram-videos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Gushes Over Bridgertons Sex Scene In Instagram Videos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
