The brand put itself on the map by innovating products where comfort meets shapewear. Like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Spanx leggings</a>, these Tight-End Tights are a reflection of that. They're our best overall pick, ticking boxes of comfort, durability, and style. These tights offer not just a control top but also a mid-thigh shaper for even more support. We found the waistband really soft and stretchy and noted the legs and waist retained shape after extensive stretching as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>premium shapewear</a> should.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx continues to deliver on its legacy of luxury comfort, and in our testing, we found these tights to be very soft and silky and even noted the smooth weave. These tights aren’t fully opaque but do offer quite a bit of coverage with a subtle sheerness that makes them a stylish option. Although we noted pilling and small holes when the tights were rubbed with rough Velcro and punctured with sharp tools — yes, we take our testing very seriously — we noted that these tights are constructed so that they don't really run since the holes and damage stay contained in its own area.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While these are not the cheapest option, they are a great pick for those wanting to invest in high-quality and durable tights.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the cotton-lined gusset allows one to go sans underwear to forego any worry about VPL (visible panty lines). These tights also come in a high-waisted option for those seeking even more support and smoothing. The Tight-End Tights would be great for those wanting shapewear and support in their black tights without sacrificing comfort or style. See, you can have it all!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>Even after a month of consistent wear, we’re still giving these tights rave reviews. We've found a number of things to be true: These smoothing tights really do work like shapewear, we don’t need to pick at them or roll them back up, and they don’t change as you wash and re-wear. The opaque quality of these tights remained consistent and gave us the smooth legs of our dreams, making our clothing lay nicely on top and controlling our curves while, most importantly, remaining comfortable for all-day wear. With its confidence-boosting results and snag-free fabric, we couldn’t be happier with these shapely Spanx tights.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>A-E |<strong> Materials:</strong> Nylon, elastane, cotton gusset | <strong>Finish:</strong> Opaque | <strong>Rise:</strong> High | <strong>Care:</strong> Hand wash warm, line dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hanes-blackout-control-top-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hanes Blackout Control Top Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1620 data-sizes=750px alt=hanes-blackout-control-top-tights style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/mefzfPT3ztJyWvAwsQaT2i3nKGY=/fit-in/1500x1620/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2021-12-16at10.50.17AM-94a637f8f3694b1a894e76f5c50bd658.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>HerRoom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=2><p>They are very durable tights, withstanding our Velcro tests, and they were very resistant to puncturing.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The control-top waistline does a great job with smoothing and shaping.</p></li><li readability=0><p>This high-quality, opaque tight is budget-friendly.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These tights scored high marks for both value and durability. During our tests, we had to try really hard (and even switch to the sharper claws!) to puncture a hole. We had to use a lot of force with the rough Velcro to cause any pilling, and the soft Velcro didn’t cause any damage at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tights are soft and very opaque, with very little light passing through them. We found the control-top waistline did a great job in flattening and smoothing our midsection, however, it wasn’t as comfortable for all-day wear. These would be a great choice for wearing for a few hours for an event to take advantage of the control-top waistline. We also noted that it would be nice if they had a wider range of sizes available, as not all stores carried the larger sizes. Overall, if you are looking for budget-friendly tights that are extremely durable and have a control-top waistline, then these are a great option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>S-XL | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon and spandex | <strong>Finish:</strong> Opaque | <strong>Rise:</strong> High | <strong>Care:</strong> Hand wash, line dry or dry flat</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tear-resistant-sheertex-classic-sheer-rip-resist-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Tear-Resistant</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sheertex Classic Sheer Rip-Resist Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sheertex Classic Sheer Rip-Resist Tights" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/M2LgienRl8T-0uV_v9ytiSy2Bj0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sheertex-classic-sheer-rip-resist-tights--5fdf409c1a994fd5af751e0994d46989.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sheertex</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=1><p>These heavy-duty tights could withstand rips from sharp objects like jewelry, blades, and nails.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We appreciated the fact that it had a 90-day guarantee in case we did encounter a rip.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Because of their strength against tearing, these tights are ideal for pet owners.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They have a size-inclusive range that goes up to 3X.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>When it's at full price, these tights can be a little expensive (compared to the others on our list).</p></li><li readability=1><p>Though they’re pretty rip-resistant, these tights can still can snag and pill easily on rough surfaces.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pet-owners, rejoice!

The Sheertex Classic Sheer Rip-Resist Tights withstood finger claws, sharp jewelry, and even a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nimble</a> (mini, wearable box-cutter) — leaving no visible holes or tears. However, be wary of any Velcro closures on your furbaby’s fave sweater vest, because a few snags did occur.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These tights offer utility and comfort, with an impressive stretch capacity and a thick 6.5-inch comfort control top band for support. While these are on the pricier side, they would be worth the investment for those with pets. A more inclusive size range that goes up to 3X and the company’s focus on sustainability are pluses, as well. The 90-day guarantee and the fact they’re machine washable and can be machine-dried (which is nearly unheard of in the hosiery business) help ease the sticker shock on these tights.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>We are pleased to say that after a month of testing, these rip-resistant tights really are what they claim to be. Not only did they stand up to the trials and tribulations of our everyday lives (brushing against people on the sidewalks, bracelets clasps catching on the fabric, pets clawing onto us), but they were ultra-comfortable, too. The high-waisted, elastic-free waistband kept us feeling controlled and looking smooth while comfortably shaping our waists, all without rolling down or hurting our stomachs. We can wear these for days on end without feeling uncomfortable or wishing we could rush home to take them off. Though its price point sounds high, we think this is an item worth splurging on (think about it, you won’t need to buy any more tights after you purchase these ones).<strong></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS-3X<strong> </strong>| <strong>Materials: </strong>Nylon, polyethylene, spandex | <strong>Finish:</strong> Semi-opaque | <strong>Rise:</strong> High | <strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash cold, tumble dry low</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-durable-no-nonsense-super-opaque-control-top-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Durable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>No Nonsense Super-Opaque Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="No Nonsense Super-Opaque Control-Top Tights" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/IvrmLocb9slbBH-GHgyGnOaoZlU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-no-nonsense-womens-opaque-control-top-53363ca9214d46238fd7af10e35139d1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>We thought these tights came at a great value since we got two in a single pack.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite our tiresome tests, these tights proved to be snag- and rip-resistant.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Want tights that’ll hold up to wear and tear of everyday use?

On top of that, these tights withstood several passes of finger claws inside the tights before eventually giving way to a snag; however, running jewelry and finger claws on top of the tights yielded no visible damage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One mark against these tights is the lack of a tag to indicate the back of the tights (which would be helpful when putting them on). With minimal sheerness, these tights offer great coverage and add warmth. These are a great pick for those wearing tights for a uniform or anyone who needs them to last through a rigorous workday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>Throughout the weeks of testing, these tights continued to have the stronghold that they did during our initial test. We went about our normal routines, going around town and doing our things at home while never experiencing a single rip or snag. Plus, they remained soft and smooth-feeling on our legs when we wore them throughout the day, providing comfort instead of restriction. Our only qualms were the opacity of the tights around our thighs (which tended to sheer out in comparison to our calves) and they stretched out a bit throughout the month.

We loved how they fit and comfortably hugged our waists, making us feel controlled without sacrificing comfort. If you’re looking for a pair of opaque tights, these are certainly the ones, because we couldn’t see even the faintest hint of skin through the midnight mesh. Because they’re a little thicker than sheerer tights, these took a bit more time to wriggle ourselves into — but in the end, this helped them hold their shape and not stretch or tear after multiple washes and wears. All in all, this affordable pair held up well to our everyday lives and provided the sleek, black look we were going for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS-XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon and spandex | <strong>Finish:</strong> Opaque | <strong>Rise:</strong> High | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stretch-wolford-satin-touch-20-denier-comfort-sheer-pantyhose></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Stretch</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wolford Satin Touch Sheer Pantyhose</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wolford Satin Touch 20 Denier Comfort Sheer Pantyhose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0yrpBje2WSO7spqi8eCd1k0ZqkA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wolford-satin-touch-20-denier-comfort-sheer-pantyhose-17b58413ff224d6e82449eea94dd518d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bare Necessities</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>Because of its low-density thickness (only 20 denier), these tights were super stretchy.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The thin, high-quality fabric gave our legs a sheer and shiny look.</p></li><li readability=0><p>They have a more inclusive size range than others on the list, which we appreciate.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The days of yanking and pulling at your tights before putting them on are over because Wolford has delivered a stretchy tight.

And they really go the distance when it comes to stretchability, with one tester remarking, “Even after stretching these out to what felt like yards, the retention of the silhouette was not significantly impacted.” Being a sheer tight, the durability is lacking with this pair, and when tested with Velcro and sharp jewelry, snags and small rips were noted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong><br>We can’t say enough good things about these buttery tights — from their luminous sheerness to their stretchiness, this pair set our standards extremely high for the rest of the test. These tights feel like they’ve sunk into our skin with how lightweight they are, allowing us to wear them for full work days and happy hours afterward and never notice a bit of discomfort. We were pleased with how well they held up after several washes and wears too, which originally made us nervous due to the super-thin material they’re made from (yet they proved to be quite resilient, with not even a trace of pilling).

We do advise you to pay attention to the care instructions and wash them carefully, as they are a bit fragile in the wash despite their structured waistline.

More than keeping us warm, these tights truly felt like pajamas — we never wanted to take them off. While we wouldn’t recommend these in the summer, we do think they will last for years due to their durability and thicker fabric (the washing machine was no foe to this material).

Also, fuller coverage tights are great for warmth in the colder months. “A little more minimalist? Stick to an easy 50 denier, which should be everyone’s staple,” says Causing.</li><li><strong>Durability: </strong>While one might not associate durability with black tights, advancements in technology and fabrics now allow for tights to handle more wear and tear than ever before. It’s important to consider what level of durability you require in a pair of tights and when or where you’ll be wearing them most. Having a pet is also a big consideration. If you’re a pet owner, we found that <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sheertex Classic Rip-Resist</a> tights stand up to claws. If you wear black tights regularly or are concerned about clothing waste, Causing encourages you to look for brands touting durability.</li><li><strong>Comfort and Fit: </strong>You want tights that not only make you look great and are durable but also comfortable with the right amount of stretch. The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Wolford Satin Touch Tights</a> get high marks for all of the above. Finding the right fit is key, with personal preference playing a role. Some people prefer the high-rise tights for their smoothing and secure fit, while others may find them constricting and prefer a mid-rise tight. Many of the tights we featured have size guides on the website to help you find the best fit, or you can go into the store to try them on. Our overall top choice, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Spanx Tight-End Tights</a>, is a good choice for their size-inclusive range. You should also keep in mind the weight of the tight. A thick tight will feel good in the winter, but you may want to switch to a sheer tight in the summer.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> Tights run the gamut when it comes to pricing. The tights we tested range from $5 to $75, with a median price of $13. In our testing, we found that sometimes you get what you pay for, with more durable and comfortable tights coming in at a higher price range (usually around $25). However, we found some great budget picks that are easier on the wallet and less of a blow in case they do catch a snag or a run, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">No Nonsense Black Tights</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hanes Control-Top Blackout Tights</a>.<br></li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested 28 pairs of black tights ranging from luxury brands to Amazon finds. After all tests were complete, we rated each pair of tights based on a 1 to 5 scale (5 being the best) against the following testing attributes: stretch, opaqueness, durability, and value. Ultimately, the tights with the highest average ratings earned a spot on this PEOPLE Tested list. Here is the specifics on our testing methods:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Texture and Feel:</strong> We evaluated the texture and feel of the tights by trying them on and noting initial observations on softness and stretch.</li><li><strong>Stretch: </strong>Using clamps, the tights were stretched even further to see just how far these tights could go. We stretched each pair lengthwise from waist to toe and also stretched the width of the waistband. Two separate testers held opposite ends of the tights with clamps and pulled as far as they could. Once they let go, they noted whether the tights were able to make it back to their original shape.</li><li><strong>Opacity:</strong> Next, we moved on to evaluate the opacity of each pair of tights by stretching the tight and holding it up in front of a spotlight, noting how much light was visible through the leg of the tight.</li><li><strong>Durability: </strong>Our durability tests were extensive and thorough with each tester rubbing both soft and hard Velcro across the tights while observing any snags, pulls, or tears. We then moved on to sharp jewelry like rings and claws to see how the tights would fare. The final durability test was dragging a Nimble (a small wearable, finger-blade) across the tights and assessing the damage.<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-6fc58180-edaf-4d00-b966-e2e5f1a3e349></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=46.529080675422><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.92926045016077><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the best thick black tights?</span></p><p>Our top pick for a thick black tight is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Spanx Tight-End Tights</a>.
