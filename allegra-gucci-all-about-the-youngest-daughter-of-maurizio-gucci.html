The killer was hired by his ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani. Maurizio came from an entrepreneur’s family. Despite his father’s strong resistance, he fell in love with Patrizia and married her. As a result, his father barred him from working in the family company.</p><p>His father welcomed him again following the birth of their children. Things altered radically following his father’s death. Because of his 50% ownership of the company, Maurizio rose to the position of chairman. Things didn’t stop there. Legal conflicts ensued between him and his uncles since even they were the stakeholders in the firm.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Allegra-Gucci-1.jpg alt="Allegra Gucci" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He was unable to spend time with his family because of his legal issues. To get away from all the stress he was under, he moved away from them and met a new love interest called Paola Franchi. The affection he had for his wife began to fade. Even after Patrizia’s brain tumor operation, he showed no compassion or love for her.&nbsp;He began the divorce process in order to marry Franchi. His ex-wife plotted a well-executed murder scheme to kill him because of her anger, jealousy, and loss of status. For her acts, Patrizia was sentenced to 29 years in jail.</p><h2>Why did Allegra choose to be a lawyer?</h2><p>Allegra had a strong relationship with her mother, Patrizia. Her mother, on the other hand, was arrested for plotting Maurizio’s murder. As a result, she decided to become a lawyer and worked hard to achieve her goal. Although the specifics of her professional work remain unclear.</p><p>She did, however, write a book titled Fin dei Gioch, which chronicles her life narrative, the predicament she experienced at a young age, her father’s murder mystery, and her mother.</p><h2>Allegra Discusses Her Father’s Death</h2><p>Allegra never spoke out about either her father’s or her mother’s deaths. But, after 27 years, she wrote a book about her life and incidents. Her father died when she was 14 years old. She found out about her father’s death via a news source. She spilled the beans on her folks.&nbsp;She described how their love story faded over time. She admitted that Franchi was not the reason for her parent’s divorce. When she was four years old, her father cheated on her mother. Her father has had several relationships since then.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Allegra-Gucci-2.jpg alt="Allegra Gucci" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They have had a schism in their marriage since 1985. After her mother was jailed on allegations of murdering her own ex-husband, her grandma seized care of her and her older sister. She described how her mother was persuaded by others, and how her mother’s brain surgery had an effect on her, compelling her to do such a horrific deed. Aside from all of this, she also divulged other family secrets in her book.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Allegra has a $400 million net worth. She owns the yacht Creole.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYpaSVnL%2BiecaumpyhXZa5rXnAm6aurF2ptaZ52Kisp5%2BVqMFusMCunqGslad6sLKMppiuqpmvtrB5xq6anKFf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hilary-farr-illness.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Hilary Farr Currently Battling an Illness?
