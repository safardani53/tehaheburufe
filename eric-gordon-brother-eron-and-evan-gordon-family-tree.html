His youngest brother, Eron Gordon, plays in the G-League.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Coming from a basketball family, Eric Gordon and his brother haven’t let their family legacy die down. Along with having individual careers, the three brothers also look after their family basketball business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eric-gordon.jpg><p>The business was founded by their father, Eric Gordon Sr, an alum of Liberty University. Gordon Sr was the first coach to his three sons and now to many with E3 Basketball Academy.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2017 Sixth Man of The Year, Eric Gordon, in his 15-year-long career in the NBA, has played for three franchises and has had <a href=# rel=noopener>Anthony Davis</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Russel Westbrook</a> as his teammates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, Gordon returned to his first NBA team, Los Angeles Clippers, but now they have chosen to waive the veteran’s contract and have refused to pay his $20.9 million salary.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eric Gordon Brother, Evan, And Eron Gordon</h2><p>Eric Gordon has two younger brothers, Evan and Eron Gordon. The Gordon brothers share the same passion for the sport and have played basketball professionally.&nbsp;</p><p>Being the eldest of the bunch, Eric inspired his brothers to kick-start their careers in the sport. But only Eric broke into the NBA with his youngest brother playing in the G-League.&nbsp;</p><h3>Evan Gordon Is A Basketball Head Coach</h3><p>The middle child of the family, Evan Gordon first tried his luck as a basketball player, and in 2021 he moved on from becoming one.&nbsp;</p><p>A graduate of Arizona State University, Evan Gordon first committed to Liberty University straight out of high school. He joined Arizona in 2011 and graduated in 2013 with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies.&nbsp;</p><p>During his days at Liberty and Arizona, Evan was part of the basketball team. In his freshman season, Evan was named to the 2010 Big South All-Freshman tea and earned the VASID All-State Rookie of the Year honor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eric-gordon-brother-eron-gordon.jpg><p>Evan ended up as the 26th all-time scoring player for Liberty before he left in 2011. In Arizona, Evan played 35 games in his redshirt junior season, averaging 10.1 points per game.&nbsp;</p><p>Gordon then joined Indiana University Bloomington to earn his master’s degree. He accomplished his goal in 2014 and earned a degree in Sports Management. And even in Indiana, Evan was part of the basketball team.&nbsp;</p><p>Evan has been working as the head basketball coach for Shantou University since 2021. He is available on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> with the username @evangordon10 and has shared several posts of his training sessions.&nbsp;</p><h3>Eron Gordon Is A UX Designer And A Basketball Player&nbsp;</h3><p>Eron Gordon, the youngest brother of Eric Gordon, was born on November 7, 1997. He is a former player at Valparaiso and completed his bachelor’s and master’s from the same university.&nbsp;</p><p>Eron joined Valparaiso after having played at Seton Hall University for two seasons. He played 48 games as a Pirate and scored 69 points before switching his university in 2018.</p><p>In his first season at Valparaiso, Eron played 35 games and averaged 5.2 points. He did slightly better in 2020, scoring 6.8 points per game in 28 matches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eric-gordon-brother-eron-gordon-1.jpg><p>2021 marked his final year with Valparaiso, playing 32 games and starting in 15. He averaged 3.2 points per game. In 2020, the younger brother Eric Gordon was also recognized with the Valparaiso University Male Unsung Hero Award.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, there was news about Eron joining Houston Rockets in the Summer League Play, which he did. And though he didn’t make his NBA debut with the Rockets, Eron attracted interest from the G-League and joined RGV Vipers.&nbsp;</p><p>He also works as a UX Designer for the family business, E3 Basketball Academy, and has previously worked as a skills trainer for Indiana Fever.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eric Gordon Parents, Eric Gordon Sr, And Denise Gordon&nbsp;</h2><p>Eric Gordon’s parents, Eric Gordon Sr, and Denise Gordon, raised their three athletic boys in Indianapolis.&nbsp;</p><p>The former Rockets player, Eric Gordon, came from a family that highly prioritized sports. His grandfather chose a location to settle down where his son could hit the gym and play basketball.&nbsp;</p><p>So, his father, Eric Gordon Sr., did as his father wanted him to do. Gordon Sr was a standout player at Liberty University. He also happened to meet his wife, Denise, at the same place.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eric-gordon-parents.jpg><p>When he graduated from Liberty University, Gordon Sr was honored with the name “Mr. Clutch” and earned a Political Science and Business Administration degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Before founding the family business E3 Basketball Academy, Gordon Sr. worked in the pharmaceutical industry for 30 years as a sales representative and regional sales manager.&nbsp;</p><p>His mother, Denise Gordon, comes from the Bahamas and is one of six kids. Denise worked as a teacher before her retirement, and education always took the first spot for the mother of three.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, the NBA player has shared posts as a tribute to his parents on various occasions. It’s clear as daylight that Eric is grateful to those who helped him reach this point in his career.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCx0aKaZp%2Bfp7GwuoybqaismJq%2FbrHRqKVmmZ6ZeqbCwKdkoKeimbyvecWapKKkqWLBs7HEaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-keida.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Michael Keida net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./don-benjamin-wife-liane-pregnant-baby.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Don Benjamin And Wife Liane V Announce Theyre Pregnant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
