Hart of Dixie won over audiences with its love triangles, heartwarming friendships and southern charm.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Rachel Bilson</strong></a> led the cast of the CW series from September 2011 to March 2015, portraying lovable New York doctor turned Alabama resident Zoe Hart. <a href=#><strong>Wilson Bethel</strong></a> (Wade Kinsella) and <a href=#><strong>Scott Porter</strong></a> (George Tucker) played her love interests, while <a href=#><strong>Cress Williams</strong></a> (Lavon Hayes) took on the role of the town’s mayor and Zoe’s best friend. The leading lady frequently butted heads with <a href=#><strong>Jaime King</strong></a> and <strong>Tim Matheson</strong>’s father-daughter duo, Lemon Breeland and Brick Breeland, respectively, though the trio came to adore each other eventually. A supporting cast of wacky locals rounded out the ensemble.</p><p>The show ended its run after four seasons as <a href=#>Bilson prepared to give birth to her first child</a>. Some fans speculated that Hart of Dixie was canceled prematurely due to the actress’ impending arrival, but she later set the record straight.</p><p>“Missing the #zoehart #hartofdixie days, especially this outfit and this lady,” the <a href=#>O.C.</a> alum wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in July 2015. “Just wanted to clear something up, the cancellation of HOD had nothing to do with me or my pregnancy. I loved my show and loved playing Zoe Hart, thanks to everyone who watched.”</p><p>The cast certainly took fond memories and friendships from the set. “Hart of Dixie, which was obviously a really pivotal part of my life and my career, it’s been, I think, four or five years now since it ended, and fortunately, I still feel so connected to the people I did that show with and the material itself,” Bethel told <a href=#>TVLine</a> in November 2019. “But I think the fact that people are still finding that show for the first time and rewatching it, it’s an incredibly special thing, and I still, to this day, have an incredible affection for that show and that character. I give a huge amount of respect [for Hart of Dixie] in terms of where that’s kind of brought me to today.”</p><p>The actor added that during a recent reunion with the stars of the show and its creator, <strong>Leila Gerstein</strong>, “word was being kind of bandied about trying to do some kind of redux situation, so we’ll see what happens with that.” Bethel then noted that he “would love to work with all of them again.”</p><p>Bilson fueled <a href=#>chatter about a revival</a> in December 2020. “Oh, I would totally do it. We all love each other. We have such a good group. We have a group chat that we’re always checking in and stuff,” she told <a href=#>PopCulture.com</a>. “I would love to do it. It was such a great experience. I loved playing Zoe, and I really did love everyone I worked with. So, if the opportunity arose, I would definitely do it. … We’re always saying, ‘Let’s bring it back. What can we do?’ Everyone’s into it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Porter, for his part, reflected on <a href=#>his onscreen romance with <strong>Kaitlyn Black</strong></a> (AnnaBeth Nass) in June 2021. “Oh man, George Tucker. He was just a romantic in every sense of the word,” he exclusively told Us Weekly. “I think the relationship with AnnaBeth is very strong. And so organic and something that came out of left field for both of them and then felt so right immediately. I have a hard time believing that the two of them don’t end up together.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see where the Hart of Dixie cast is now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BdrrPAjKidZpyZrbamecKaqq1lp52ys7GMmqmeZaSdsrp5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-make-best-martini-classic-recipe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Make the Perfect Martini, Plus Recipes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shirley-muldowney.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Shirley Muldowney net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
