Me.”</p><p>“She kept her T-shirt on. It was really hot,” Sandoval responded.</p><p>While <strong><a href=#>Lala Kent</a></strong> called him a “f—king d—k” on the show, Ariana took to Instagram in real-time to drop a <a href=#>shirt</a> that reads: “F—k Me in This T-Shirt.” The tee is being sold through Ariana and <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong>’</a>s upcoming sandwich shop, Something About Her, for $34.99.</p><p>The<a href=#> three-part reunion</a> documented Ariana slamming both Sandoval and Raquel, 28, for <a href=#>their months-long affair</a>. Throughout the episodes, the TomTom co-owner <a href=#>doubled down on his suggestion</a> that one of the reasons he cheated was because the couple wasn’t happy or <a href=#>having sex regularly.</a></p><p>“Tom made the comment that he did about Ariana being intimate, but, you know, her wearing a T-shirt and how that wasn’t hot — I think he was exhausted at that point,” Vanderpump Rules <a href=#>executive producer <strong>Alex Baskin</strong></a> told <a href=#>Variety</a> in a video published on Wednesday. “And I think he felt like he’d taken a lot of incoming fire. And I think he made a really regrettable, stupid comment that was bad at the time and then actually has played even worse than I remember it, which is saying something, because we all, like, you know, gasped when we saw it.”</p><p>Baskin added: “He kind of amplified everything that everyone thought anyway, and I think instead of people feeling bad for him in some way even though he, you know, put himself in this situation, I think that made him seem like an asshole.”</p><p>During the same video, <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> noted that Ariana was “poised” as she navigated her “rage” during the reunion — “She was pretty amazing” — but he couldn’t say the same for Sandoval.</p><p>“This was a redemptionless situation for him, I think really. In terms of how he did … Not great,” he said. “He was a shell of himself, really. He was shaking. I’ve never seen him in that shape. And <a href=#>that was a bad line</a>.”</p><p>The special concluded with Raquel <a href=#>coming clean about new details</a> of the affair via a confessional interview after confirming that Sandoval encouraged her to lie to their costars about the timeline of their romance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Sandoval] feels like it would be less hurtful to say that, you know, this wasn’t going on for so long. [But] the second time was actually during Mexico [at <strong><a href=#>Scheana Shay </a></strong><a href=#>and</a><strong><a href=#> Brock Davies’ </a></strong><a href=#>August 2022 wedding</a>],” she admitted. “He is my one person that I do have and if I just went and betrayed him then I’d really have nobody.”</p><p>Scroll through for more reactions to the controversial comment:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWv6qtzZpkppmUnsVuvNSmp2aqpaGytHnCmqqtZaKarqTA0marqGWjlrulu9Wao6xlpGLAqbXRrWSdoZdk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bolton-1-birmingham-0-report.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bolton 1 Birmingham 0: Will Buckley strikes late to leave Garry Monk's Brum searching for first Cham</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-was-a-royal-runaway-romance-filmed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Was A Royal Runaway Romance Filmed?
