Favre has a happy family of four, comprising his wife Deanna and his two daughters.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, much of his professional success, as well as his current family, wouldn’t have been possible without his wife’s support. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Because of his superstardom, Favre had lost sight of what was important to him and was heading down the wrong road. It was Deanna who helped him get back on the right track.</p><h2>Brett Favre and Wife</h2><p>Favre and Deanna first met during a catechism class when she was seven and he was six.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Growing up, they became high-school sweethearts. <a href=# rel="follow noopener">According to Milwaukee Magazine</a>, the pair started dating after playing a game of H-O-R-S-E when Deanna and Favre found themselves shooting hoops after his brother’s surprise birthday party. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Favre was 14 at the time, and Deanna was 15. After four years together, Deanna became pregnant with their first child, daughter Brittany Nicole, who was born on February 6, 1989.</p><p>They tied the knot on July 14, 1996. Three years later, their family of three grew larger when Deanna gave birth to their daughter, Breleigh.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Brett Favre with his daughters</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><h2>Deanna Helped Favre Overcome His Addiction</h2><p>Favre started attracting a lot of attention because of his athleticism when he began playing for The University of Southern Mississippi.&nbsp;</p><p>He was already a well-known name in the sport, and his fame increased even further after he was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the 1991 NFL Draft. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, with fame came a huge amount of pressure, and he soon found himself addicted to painkillers. On top of his addiction, many rumors about him seeing other women were floating around.</p><p>Because of the reasons mentioned above, their relationship grew rocky. Things between Favre and Deanna worsened when he started ignoring her and their daughter Brittany after they moved to Green Bay full time to be with him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Brett Favre with wife and daughters</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Deanna eventually confronted him about his Vicodin abuse, but things didn’t work out. She tried alerting others in the Packers organization, but she was dismissed as a jealous girlfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In her autobiography titled Don’t Bet Against Me! Deanna recounted another incident that almost <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ended their relationship</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>“One night, I walked into the room and heard Brett talking on the phone to a woman I had discovered he’d been calling,” she wrote. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“‘That’s it,’ I told him. ‘I don’t deserve to be treated like this. You asked me to move up here to Green Bay and now you’re calling these girls–well, now you’re on your own. I’m not living this way. All this stuff is over for me.’”</p><p>However, she was convinced by Steve Mariucci’s wife, Gayle Mariucci, to stay as she believed Favre would end up killing himself by abusing Vicodin.</p><p>She stuck with him, and he went public with his Vicodin addiction in May 1996. Shortly after he came out of his 46-day rehabilitation, he asked her to marry him, and she agreed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqimsG1ecWaraudXay2p7GNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./90-day-fiance-love-in-paradise-season-3-premiere-date.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Details on 90 Day Fianc: Love In Paradise' Season 3: Premiere Date, Cast, and More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-tiffany-pratt-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Tiffany Pratt Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
