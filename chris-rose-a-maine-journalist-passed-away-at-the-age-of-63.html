You could always count on him to meet deadlines, to provide accurate, fascinating, and full stories, and never waste words. That was most likely his producer training at work.”</p><p>Callaghan will leave News Center Maine in December of 2022.</p><h2>Chris Rose’s career as a journalist throughout the years</h2><p>Chris Rose began his television news career at WSMW-TV in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was a writer and producer for WBZ-TV in Boston. He eventually joined News Center Maine, where he worked for more than three decades.&nbsp;Chris started working as a broadcast producer for WCSH in 1986. He subsequently followed his calling and started working in front of cameras as a news reporter.

Shannon Moss, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety and Chris’ coworker for seven years, voiced her astonishment when she heard of his death. She stated:</p><p>“Chris was more on the quiet side but he had a terrific sense of humor, and a lovely grin and he truly enjoyed being a parent to his two children. And, although many of us have gone on from News Center Maine, we still consider ourselves a family, and this loss is very painful.”</p><p>Sarah Delage, Chris’ coworker at News Center Maine for five years and now UNE’s director of public relations and communications stated:</p><p>“With his decades of narrative expertise, understanding of the Maine media scene, and generally calm and steady manner, he was a delight to work with. “He was appreciated and respected by our whole communications and marketing staff.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chris-Rose-2.jpg alt="Chris Rose" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She went on to say that Chris had a calm, steady demeanor that helped him in public relations and in the press.
