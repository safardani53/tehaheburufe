But I couldn't get on any television."</p><p>Desperate to continue his role in the media, the 1998 Premier League winner with <a href=#>Arsenal </a>embarked on a career in radio and it ended up being the start of his comeback journey to tele.</p><p>It led to him getting the job as host of a documentary about <a href=#>Laurie Cunningham</a>, who was a pioneer for black footballers.</p><p>Wright explained: "This is where Absolute Radio came in and everyone down there almost saved me, made me fall back in love with doing it.</p><p>"To get back onside with Sloan from ITV, he wanted to do a documentary about Cunningham and the people doing it said: 'We can't do a documentary without me speaking about Cunningham.'</p><p>"And so Sloan was like: 'Okay he'll do it, but he'll do it if you give him a game again, let him get back on the TV.'</p><p>"So I done it, it done really well and they gave me a game.</p><p>"They gave me <a href=#>Chelsea </a>against Brentford in the FA Cup and I was very fortunate because I was on with Martin Allen, who was somewhere else in space while he was on TV.</p><p>"Everything he was saying I was able to counter-attack it and say, 'well that's not right because of this.'</p><p>"I remember David Luiz really dived into somebody and I remember digging him out for that and then after that people were writing in saying: 'Where's he been? Why isn't he on then?'</p><p>"And it just turned on its head, I was back.</p><p>"What it made me realise is you've got to put the work in."</p><p>Wright ended up landing a more permanent role on MOTD in 2015 after helping to convince BBC chiefs while doing international fixtures on ITV.</p><p>Leaving once again is a tough decision - but Wright believes he has made the right one, explaining: "The <a href=#>time's come for it I think</a>.</p><p>"I don't want to go too deep into what it means to me but the music, every time I hear the music, it takes me back to an unbelievable place when I first remembered what <a href=#>Match of the Day</a> meant to me.</p><p>"Then to get myself into a position where I was able to be good enough to be on Match of the Day and then be a regular, it was more than I thought it was going to be.</p><p>"When I first went on, not very rehearsed in what I was going to say or what I was going to be, I was winging it and I remember <a href=#>Des Lynam</a>, when he welcomed me on to the show, I said to him 'this is my Graceland'.</p><p>"Match of the Day was my Graceland.</p><p>"When I first got the call for it, it does hit hard. You are nervous, because some people still don't realise, It's live.</p><p>"People still say 'it's live?' Yeah.
