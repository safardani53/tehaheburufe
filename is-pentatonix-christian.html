Often stylized as simply PTX, Pentatonix, which currently consists of vocalists Mitch Grassi, Scott Hoying, Kirstin Maldonado, Kevin Olusola, and Matt Sallee, has taken the world of a capella music by storm since their inception over a decade ago. In that time, they have achieved international success for their collective singing abilities.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Pentatonix's fame as a music group is undeniable at this point, but what do we know about their faith? Namely, are Pentatonix members openly Christian? Here's what we know about the belief systems of one of the world's most popular all-singer groups.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Pentatonix a Christian group?</h2><p>If the fact that they've released 84 Christmas songs and won multiple Grammys in the process isn't enough to convince you, all of the members of Pentatonix are open about their profound affiliations with the Christian church. With that being said, are they making music that only Christians can enjoy? No, and they aren't officially billed as a Christian group, either. Many of their cover songs are general pop music as well.</p><p>As for the group's members, however, Christianity is as important as can be in their personal lives. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Post</a>, Kevin Olusola said, "During my junior year of college, that's when God called me to go into music. It was very clear. I got on my knees, my junior year of college in my dorm, and I said, 'God, I know you're calling me to this, you're going to have to set the path for me because I have absolutely no idea how to get from medicine into music.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As for Mitch Grassi, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Out</a>, the singer is openly gay, which conflicts with some traditionalist Christian values. Nonetheless, the singer still claims the faith and grew up worshipping it.</p><p>A similar thing can be said about Scott Hoying, who is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">openly bisexual</a>. Nonetheless, he remains a follower of the faith.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In terms of Kirstin Maldonado, one need only look at the permanent ink on her skin to see her affiliation with Christianity. Out of her many tattoos, one clearly visible one reads "Philippians 4:13," which is a Christian bible verse.</p><p>When it comes to Matt Sallee, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentatonix Wiki</a>, the singer has been affiliated with Christianity through music his entire life. From an early age, Matt sang in choirs, as he is the son of a music minister.</p><p>Though the group is not Christian, it's clear their faith is part of what motivates them in their careers, and they've continued to use their platform to cover a range of music genres.</p><p>"[We can] show people how beautiful and joyous and cool the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gospel is</a>. I think there's a lot of stigma around the Gospel; that 'it's just not for me,' 'it can't be.' But actually, Jesus invites every single person into a relationship," Kevin said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvMSnq5qsn6O2uXnCoamiq6Serq8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jaime-king-tags-estranged-husband-kyle-newman-in-sons-birthday-post.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jaime King Tags Estranged Husband Kyle Newman in Sons Birthday Post</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./british-museum-busted-billion-crime-great-rhino-horn-robbery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Incredible story of how a Brit exposed multi-million pound crime wave of mobsters raiding museums fo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
