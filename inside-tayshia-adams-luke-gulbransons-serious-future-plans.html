The Summer House alum’s former costar <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong></a> later confirmed that Gulbranson was dating Adams <a href=#>after posting a photo of the duo holding hands.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tayshia-Adams-Luke-Gulbranson-Ring-Shopping.jpg><p>“I did not know they were holding hands until everyone started commenting and was like, ‘Oh, they’re holding hands!’ And I was like, ‘Oh s—t, they’re holding hands!’” Hubbard, 36, told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> in April about the since-deleted post. “But I understand what it’s like to be in the public and the pressure that you feel from viewers and fans [and] everywhere.”</p><p>The former publicist, who is engaged to <a href=#><strong>Carl Radke</strong></a>, hinted that she was asked to remove the post after it went viral. “When Carl and I started dating we were just trying to keep it as private as possible because you want to enjoy those moments, so I understand,” she explained on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen at the time.</p><p>One month later, the former Bachelorette was <a href=#>photographed trying on rings with Gulbranson during a trip to Tiffany & Co</a>. Adams, for her part, was previously married to<a href=#><strong> Josh Bourelle</strong></a> from 2016 to 2017.</p><p>The ABC personality went on find love again with <a href=#><strong>Zac Clark</strong></a> after appearing on season 16 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>. The pair got engaged during the December 2020 finale — but <a href=#>ultimately called it quits less than a year later</a>.</p><p>“Him and I both know the truth and where we stand, and I’ve actually never said anything in the media about our relationship except for [that] we’re no longer together,” Adams detailed to Us in December 2022. “And I know people might think otherwise, but that’s literally the only statement we’ve ever given out. I think that’s just something about maturity and how we decided to proceed and yeah, at the end of the day, no one else needs to know anything else.”</p><p>Adams also explained <a href=#>why she planned to keep her next romance out</a> of the spotlight.</p><p>“I think that’s another lesson I’ve learned is I really wanna protect that in the future, and kind of, maybe, keep it quiet and under wraps for a minute and then maybe let the people in on the news after a little while,” she shared. “People are private investigators. I don’t even know how they figure out half the things they do now.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gulbranson, meanwhile, has been linked to former costars <a href=#><strong>Hannah Berner</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ciara Miller</strong></a>.
