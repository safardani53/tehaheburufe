He and his parents, Josh and Cassie Sutton, recently completed the 2,100-mile adventure across 14 states in 209 days, the outlet reported.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It started out as a joke and we decided maybe that could be our mini-retirement and hike the Appalachian Trail with Harvey," Josh told NPR about getting his son prepared for the epic journey. "We started training [him] at a young age to hike and camp and he took on to it really well."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harvey was 2-years-old when his parents first started building up his stamina by taking him for mini walks, NPR reported. The boy was 4 when the Suttons began their journey in January in Georgia and they just finished the climb last week in Maine, according to the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We learned that he is fabulous at hiking, but as long as we're playing make-believe and pretend with him all day long, then he moves quickly and hikes a lot faster than a lot of us imagine," Josh told NPR.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It gave us a bond and a strength that we hadn't realized before," mom Cassie Sutton added to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Associated Press</a>. "We're closer than ever before."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though challenging, Harvey's parents said their son still found the tricky hike rather exciting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he wasn't looking for wildlife like frogs and lizards, he was pairing Skittles with peanut butter tortillas for energy, according to the AP.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think a lot of people are surprised at how well he did," Cassie admitted to NPR. "They're like, 'How did you get your 5-year-old to do that because my 5-year-old won't even walk half a mile without complaining?' Everyone is pretty amazed and astounded."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Meet the Father of Two With ALS Who Is Hiking 600-Miles of the Appalachian Trail to Raise Awareness</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, Harvey added to the outlet, "I would do it again because I like it so much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The rock scrambles were really fun and hard.
