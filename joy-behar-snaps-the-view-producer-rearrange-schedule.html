We are here. It's Thursday, not your normal Wednesday taping, but we have Joy Behar here," Brian said.</p><p>"Lucky for all the audience at home. How are you?"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON JOY BEHAR">READ MORE ON JOY BEHAR</h2><p>Instead of answering Brian's question, Joy asked: "Why am I here on a Thursday today?"</p><p>"I think because we had Matt Rogers on yesterday," Brian responded.</p><p>Matt is a comedian, author, producer, singer, host, and podcaster.</p><p>"So what? What's that got to do with anything?" Joy wondered.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"He was on the show, on the podcast, and we thought that'd be good with me and Sara and him," the producer explained, referring to <a href=#>Sara Haines</a>. "Especially after the whole foot thing."</p><p>"So, in other words," Joy interjected. "I have to readjust my schedule according to your whims?"</p><p>"-To accommodate Matt Rogers," Brian said.</p><p>"Yes. Yes, the whims of Brian Teta."</p><p>Joy just chuckled as Brian went on with the first topic of the episode.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>YIKES!</strong></h2><p>On the day before Joy was on the podcast, Matt appeared on <a href=#>The View</a>.</p><p>He talked about a time when he was on the talk show and <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>&nbsp;performed.</p><p>Proclaiming himself "Kelly Clarkson's biggest fan," Matt recalled a time when someone else was selected from the audience, instead of him, to see Kelly.</p><p>The producers rolled a clip of when he sat in the audience beside his friend Bowen Yang as the other fan spoke to the panelists.</p><p>Matt said he was "horrified" that the fan at the time was getting to be in the spotlight.</p><p>He spoke about the fan on their podcast, Las Culturistas with Matt Rogers and <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>'s&nbsp;<a href=#>Bowen Yang</a>.</p><p>The fan had mentioned to Matt that it had made him "feel bad" and he apologized.</p><p>The singer mentioned he ran into the other fan at a Kelly concert later on in life and the pair "cleared the air."</p><p>"Now we're all friends,"&nbsp;Sara interjected.</p><p>"Not me,"&nbsp;Joy&nbsp;said.</p><p>"No, you're mad at me?" Matt wondered.</p><p>"Now that you've outed me," Joy joked about Matt's reveal that she had gone barefoot on a plane.</p><p>"Listen!" Matt pleaded.</p><p>"I mean, you weren't hiding it, Joy. Your feet were up and out!"</p><p>"She's got nice feet!" said co-host <a href=#>Sunny Hostin</a>.</p><p>The crowd couldn't stop laughing at how Matt had called Joy out earlier in the episode.</p><p>Matt <a href=#>called out</a> Joy for "dragging him," which she did due to the barefoot comment.</p><p>"She's gonna keep dragging you. Once you call her out, you're done," Sara told him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>NO JOY</strong></h2><p>Joy had a reason for dragging Matt since that's exactly what he did immediately upon sitting at the table.</p><p>When Matt came out from backstage,&nbsp;Sunny told him that the last time she had seen the comedian was on a plane back from a trip to the Bahamas.</p><p>Matt pointed out that Joy had been on the plane as well.</p><p>He turned to her early on in the interview and made a declaration about the trip that shocked her.</p><p>"You were barefoot on that plane!" Matt revealed.</p><p>Joy barely had words to respond as the audience laughed and lost their minds over the comment.</p><p>Sara&nbsp;covered her mouth in shock at Matt's confession.</p><p>"I said, I respect it!" he said.</p><p>"I wasn't walking around though," Joy told him.</p><p>Sunny played devil's advocate and agreed with the guest.</p><p>"I was seated next to her and she did take her shoes off," she told the audience.</p><p>"I respected it, it was a power move," Matt laughed.</p><p>"Shut up!" a flustered Joy yelled.</p><p>However, she appeared that she was about to burst up laughing about the situation.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I object to this court of inquiry right now!"</p><p>The panelists joked about the plane trip and what they each did in their seats, but quickly moved on afterward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/2021-abc-view-airs-monday-860363390-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/never-late-view-fans-t-857986537.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/view-guest-rips-joy-behar-864755853.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGeFcn6TaKGosV2Xsqmt0Waqp5mgqHq1tMRmraKdp2K9s7vDrpqeql2nsqK%2B0ZqloJ1dqLCpscOuo55n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mimi-fausts-husband-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mimi Fausts Husband: Who is Mimi Faust Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-guide-to-the-duggar-family-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>A Guide to Everyone in the Duggar Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
