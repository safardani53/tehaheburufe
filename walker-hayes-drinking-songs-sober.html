It was something we did for fun. I never would have suspected I’d be the TikTok guy!” he laughed. “I have a love-hate relationship with TikTok. Some of it, I’m just like, ‘This is terrible,’ but then some of it, I’m like, ‘Man, this is really creative and wholesome and good for the world.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>He admitted that with his new single, “Ya’ll Life,” he and Lela may not be dropping a dance to go along with it, but they’ll “always have ‘Fancy Like.'” “That’s our legacy,” he gushed. Walker added that “Fancy Like” going viral on TikTok did really “help with ‘AA'” and “translate to radio play.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Walker-Hayes-TikTok-Viral-Hits-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The country star also reacted to the AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) community’s response to his upbeat single, which details his urge to drink as he tries to be the best dad he can be and keep his marriage alive. Walker, who is sober, laughed, telling HL, “I love AA! But let’s go back to the first beer you ever had …Was your goal to end up in rehab one day? I was trying to relate to most people, who probably haven’t gotten to the point where they’re like, ‘I have a problem.’ But I’m really vocal about that. I’m an excellent drinker, that’s why I had to stop!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ahead of the release of his upcoming album&nbsp;Country Stuff: The Album, Walker continued, “I love drinking songs. I love them, I love to write them. Look, if it’s human, I want to write it, and alcoholism is human, so I’m gonna write both sides.” At the same time, he said, “When someone in recovery or thinking about it approaches me, all of my attention goes there, because that’s way bigger than right now and being famous.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FrZrCZnKCys3nHmrCeq12Zv6q6yqKloGWjpLuov4ysppudomQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-brian-cook-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Brian Cook Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rita-oras-red-carpet-style-see-her-best-fashion-looks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rita Oras Red Carpet Style: See Her Best Fashion Looks</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
