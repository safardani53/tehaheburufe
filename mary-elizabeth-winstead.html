In scary movies, someone has to scream to death to scare the audience, right?</p><p>And Mary played that role perfectly, and she has evolved into the scream queen of the Hollywood industry.</p><p>Her family has already paved the way for her to exhibit her talents. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is from a filmy background, but her talents and skills helped her sustain herself in the film industry for more than 25 years!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_of_Mary_Elizabeth_Winstead></span>Early Life of Mary Elizabeth Winstead<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mary Elizabeth Winstead was born on November 28, 1984, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

Sometimes our physical bodies may become a boon or a curse.</p><p>Yes, the physical body became a curse for her ballet dancing career; Mary was too tall to perform ballet, so she decided to give up ballet dancing.</p><p>Instead, her physical body turned into a boon for her acting career.</p><p>Her parents even arranged for her to be homeschooled during her adolescence because she was a tall student!</p><p>Shouldn’t they have encouraged her to face the world?
