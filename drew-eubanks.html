He is the youngest child of David and Laura Eubanks.&nbsp;</p><p>His father, Drew, worked as a mechanic while his mother was a nurse. His family migrated to the state of Oregon when Drew was just two. He attended Reynolds High School in Troutdale.</p><p>He grew up in a loving family environment playing with his older sister, Kelli. She was already into sports then, and she taught him softball while he was a young boy.</p><p>Kelli later played college softball for Colorado State University from 2008 to 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Drew-Eubanks-mother.jpg><p>Eubanks was interested in other sports as well. He played groundball and basketball, too, but baseball was his favorite.</p><p>Even now, his most significant achievement besides getting into the NBA is winning Mt. Hood Conference title in baseball.</p><p>So, if he had not chosen basketball later in high school, he would have probably become a professional baseball player.</p><p>His path changed when the high school basketball coaches invited him and told his parents that he had a body type that would be fit for a basketball athlete.</p><p>Luckily, Drew decided to dedicate his time to basketball and joined his high school team.</p><p>His parents provided him with firm support and visited him during his matches to cheer him up, believing&nbsp;that it was probably what their son was made for.</p><p>He initially intended to obtain a degree in University Exploratory Studies but could not because he dropped out after his third year.</p><h2>Basketball Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Eubanks played both high school baseball and basketball tournaments for Reynolds School. However, growing tall, he left baseball and played only basketball as a senior.</p><p>Over time, he thrived as one of the best centers in his area, with high rebound scores every season. Continuing his form, he averaged 18.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in his senior season.</p><p>Consequently, he graduated from his high school as ESPN’s top basketball athlete in Oregon in 2015 and also a four-star recruit by ESPN.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>After his high school graduation, Drew Eubanks joined Oregon State University for his college career. He said he chose the Oregon State Beavers because it was in his home state and was very close to his house.</p><p>Eubanks started his freshman (2015-16) season hoping for better performance but had an average game, with an average of 7.6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, playing all 32 games of the season.</p><p>However, there were some positive things to note from his performance that season. He was the fourth-best in field goal percentage in the Pac-12 conference and the sixth-best freshman in his college’s history regarding his 146 rebounds.</p><p>After that season, his game improved, and his scores were far better. As a sophomore on a team that won five games, he averaged 14.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game.</p><p>As a junior, Eubanks averaged 13.2 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game. He skipped his last collegiate season for the 2018 NBA Draft.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Drew Eubanks was always among one of the most talked-about young athletes when he was actively playing high school and college basketball.&nbsp;</p><p>However, to his disappointment, no NBA team bid for him, and he remained undrafted in the 2018 NBA Draft. Luckily the San Antonio Spurs came to his rescue and signed him for the 2018 NBA Summer League.</p><p>Drew signed a two-way contract with the Spurs on September 17, 2018. A month later, he debuted in the NBA regular season against the Portland Trail Blazers, which they lost by 108-121.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Drew-Eubanks-with-the-San-Antonio-Spurs.png><p>He stayed for two more seasons with the Spurs, during which the team offered him more matches.
