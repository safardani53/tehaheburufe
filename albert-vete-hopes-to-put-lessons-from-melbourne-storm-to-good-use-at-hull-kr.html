Both parents were born there and he drove with his brother to watch the Pacific island stun Great Britain in 2019 as a fan.</p><p>Now he is playing on these shores and will face some of the players he wanted to lose when he was also in the crowd for England’s World Cup semi-final in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-19.jpg><p>Vete will also have the same aim from new boss Tony Smith, even though his chilled exterior is very different from Melbourne firebrand Bellamy, who is often seen screaming in the coaches’ box.</p><p>He added: “They’re both very competitive, I saw that straight away. His vision for the team is success and that matches up with Craig.</p><p>“My first impressions of Tony are definitely the same as Craig – wanting to win, the drive to win and the drive for change here after last season.</p><p>“The coaches’ box may be quieter though. I haven’t really heard Tony swear much, which is a bit different to Craig!”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">THE LATEST IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH51fJdqbGlsX5a5o7HRrWSvnaSaeqm7z56qZqyfYr22wIylnKyrn6PAbrLRqKRmpZWhr7DB0aecZqukpL%2BuedOoZKCnn5l6tr%2FEZpitZZiqua15yqtm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jenna-colemans-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jenna Colemans Boyfriend: Who is Jenna Coleman Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-keith-colburn-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Keith Colburn Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
