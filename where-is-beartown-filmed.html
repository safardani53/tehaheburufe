Both series utilize breathtakingly beautiful long shots of the pristine land to convey a crippling sense of doom. Beartown was filmed in Sweden, while <a href=#>The Valhalla Murders</a><a href=#> was shot in Iceland</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Beartown tells the story of a promising hockey player determined to make it big — only to get too drunk on power once he starts to reach success. In a crucial scene of the series, Kevin attends a house party and sexually assaults one of his schoolmates. The incident and the following investigation shake up the whole community, raising new questions about the immense pressure put on a group of adolescent boys.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a>, Beartown was filmed in Norrbotten County, the northernmost part of Sweden. Some exterior shots were likely filmed in the Gällivare Municipality in Norrbotten County, and parts of the filming reportedly took place in Malmberget, a mining town. Additional scenes were likely shot in Övertorneå, a town near the border between Sweden and Finland, in Kiruna, and in the municipalities of Kalix and Haparanda.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The freezing temperatures posed a problem for the team behind 'Beartown.'</h2><p>As Peter Grönlund, the director of Beartown revealed in a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drama Quarterly</a>, battling the elements was far from easy.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was really harsh conditions, and the cameras just stopped working," Peter told the outlet. "We could be stuck for hours sometimes just waiting for a camera or something to replace some part of the camera that went to hell. That was really hard."&nbsp;</p><p>"But still, it's always the same with directing. You lose a lot of energy and you lose faith, but then something happens that gets you going again, like a nice performance or a shot we’re filming, and the energy comes back into you," he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearing the snow-covered roads was another challenge they had to face during the months of shooting in the Swedish mountains.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I love the frozen world that we portrayed in the first few weeks [of the shoot]. It's so important for the drama, so it was totally worth it. We used hard rigs. It wasn’t just a little camera. There were cranes and dollies and all this big equipment, and we had to create roads or paths through the snow without destroying the shots. It was crazy," Peter told Drama Quarterly.</p><p>Beartown airs Mondays at 9 p.m on HBO.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlkpqus8DOsKVmnpmhuqaw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-evans-confirms-marriage-to-alba-baptista-after-2-secret-weddings.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Evans Confirms Marriage to Alba Baptista After 2 Secret Weddings</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./red-white-and-royal-blue-deleted-scene-taylor-zakhar-perez-nicholas-galitzine-7749986.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue Deleted Scene Shows Memorable Scene from Book: Watch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
