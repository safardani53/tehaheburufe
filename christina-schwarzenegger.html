Christina and her mother co-produced and released a Netflix documentary titled “Take Your Pills” in the summer of 2018.</p><p>She had the idea for this documentary while going through her withdrawal symptoms from Adderall.</p><p>She wished there had been a documentary available at the time that she could have learned from. As a result, the show focuses on Adderall’s development, prescription, and side effects.</p><p>She was able to create a documentary with the assistance of her mother and Netflix. They desired to shed light on America’s Adderall addiction epidemic.</p><p>As a result, they conducted a series of interviews with physicians and neuroscientists about the Schedule II drug. She included interviews with current Adderall users.</p><p>Additionally, interviews with those recovering from addiction were conducted to emphasize the effects and changes in lifestyle that addiction causes.</p><p>Christina previously worked as an assistant editor at Goop.

This includes her property, funds, and earnings. Her primary source of income comes from her acting career.</p><p>She has amassed a fortune through her various sources of income but prefers to live a modest lifestyle.</p><p>While she may have a respectable net worth for a young woman entering the business, the insanely large figure belongs to her father, who has amassed a fortune, unlike anything many people could ever imagine.</p><p>While he is not a billionaire, he does possess the type of cash flow that would have made growing up in the household quite comfortable. However, the likelihood is that her net worth will eventually begin to grow.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>Who is Anna-Maria Sieklucka?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Social_Media_Appearance></span>Social Media Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christina has made a concerted effort to keep her personal life private on social media. She went so far as to delete her Instagram account.</p><p>As a result, much of what the mainstream media knows about her comes exclusively from her interviews or from her siblings.</p><p>It appears as though she is usually quite busy with something and thus cannot be on social media all of the time.</p><p>She is, however, on enough to satisfy and retain her followers. She is active on the following social media platforms:</p><ul><li><a href=#>Twitter</a>: More than 15.1 thousand Followers</li><li><a href=#>Instagram</a>: More than 1 Million Followers</li></ul><p>Finally, you really did something good today on our platform.
