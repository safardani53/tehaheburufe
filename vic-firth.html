Vic was raised by his parents in Sanford, Maine. Vic took after his trumpet player father, learning cornet at age four but turning his focus to percussion. All in all, Vic knew trombone, clarinet, piano and was adept as music arrangement. When Vic reached high school, he was a full-time percussionist and created an 18-piece band as a teenager. After high school, Vic enrolled in the new England Conservatory in Boston and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree. At the age of 21, Vic joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra and played with them for 50 years. 12 years after starting with the BSO, Vic&nbsp;started his own drumstick company, as he felt he needed a higher quality stick to perform the pieces. So, Vic started Vic Firth Company, manufacturing drumsticks and various percussion mallets. By 2012, the company offered 300 products and made 12 million sticks a year. Some musicians who endorsed his drumsticks include <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Questlove</strong></a>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Charlie Watts</a></strong> of the Rolling Stones, <strong>Vinnie Paul</strong> of Pantera, and <strong>Tony Royster Jr</strong>., who performs with <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jay Z</a>.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Vic Firth was best known as a drummer and founder of the Vic Firth Company, manufacturing sticks and mallets.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:<br></span>Vic also started a line of pepper mills, salt grinders and rolling pins, sold under the Vic Firth Gourmet brand until selling the interests to the Maine Wood Concepts (rebranded as Fletchers’ Mill.) On&nbsp;July 27, 2015, Vic’s official Facebook page announced that the drummer and businessman had passed away at the age of 85. Vic is survived by his wife, <strong>Olga</strong>, and two daughters, <strong>Kelly</strong> and <strong>Tracy</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3y3tcJmnaKqpJ18</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-el-moussa-when-did-she-last-sleep-with-tarek.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>When Did She Last Sleep with Tarek?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenners-wallpaper-is-a-never-before-seen-photo-of-her-and-timothee-chalamet-kissing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenners Wallpaper Is a Photo of Her and Timothee Chalamet Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
