They will be all mine.”</p><p>But Robbie, who is <a href=#>due to perform at the BBC Music Awards tonight at London’s ExCeL</a>, won’t have his kids banging at the door if he decides to build a secret studio.</p><p>He said: “They just aren’t interested. I played Teddy a bit of my Knebworth gig (in 2003). I sat her on my lap and told her that all those people had come to see Daddy.</p><p>“But she just sat there and then, a few minutes in, said: ‘Can I have some cake?’ and ran off to the other room. She isn’t bothered about the music.”</p><p>Luckily, Robbie has a few million fans who are a bit more interested. And they could join in for Christmas. He added: “There will be in-laws, there will be a smattering of friends.</p><p>“Anyone’s more than welcome to join the fun.”</p><h2>Ri-Ri cleans up her act</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nintchdbpict000288161888.jpg><p><strong>HER lyrics may be X-rated but there’ll be nothing dirty in <a href=#>RIHANNA’s new film</a>, as she’s playing a cleaner.</strong></p><p>This picture from her first few days on the Ocean’s Eight set in New York show her in a jumpsuit and pushing a bin.</p><p><a href=#>With<strong> HELENA BONHAM CARTER</strong> also in the comedy, </a>due out in 2018, RiRi will have to polish up her acting skills.</p><h2>Meghan’s a London girl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nintchdbpict0002866761791.jpg><p><strong><a href=#>PRINCE HARRY’s girlfriend MEGHAN MARKLE</a> was getting her fill of his city well before we knew they were dating.</strong></p><p>The director of <a href=#>gangster flick Anti-Social</a> has revealed that the actress immersed herself in London life while they shot the film there.</p><p><strong>REG TRAVISS</strong> said: “She had been before so something must have struck a chord with her.</p><p>“I got the impression she likes British culture. I know on days off she was visiting places. I don’t know if she went to see Buckingham Palace, though.”</p><p>American Meghan didn’t even mind the cold while filming outside in December.</p><p>Reg added: “She was in a mini dress and didn’t say a word.</p><p>“There were grown men on the set who couldn’t speak they were so cold.
