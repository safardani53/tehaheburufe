arguably the best in Europe - so they could compete at a higher level.</p><p>In 20 years, he has come a long way from Mister Byrite - a chain of discount stores that sold menswear he took over from his dad - to an uncompromising football club chairman</p><h2>ESSEX BOY</h2><p>Daniel was born in Essex to Jewish parents.</p><p>His father, Barry famously owned the clothing retail business, Mister Byrite which later became rebranded as Blue Inc.</p><p>As a boy he was a Spurs fan, regularly making the pilgrimage to White Hart Lane through the 1960s.</p><p>He went to Cambridge University, where he studied Economics and Land Economy - graduating with a first in 1985.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000000059233.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000691147997.jpg><p>Then, he got involved in the family business while also dabbling in property development.</p><p>Alongside ex-Tottenham vice-chairman Paul Kemsley, he set up Rock Joint Ventures, which had a stake in house-builders Countryside Properties.</p><p>His paths crossed with <a href=#>billionaire investor Joe Lewis</a>, who installed Levy as managing director of his investment trust, ENIC International.</p><p>Later, through ENIC, he would convince Alan Sugar to sell enough shares to initiate a takeover that was completed in 2001.</p><p>Today, ENIC own 85.5 per cent of Tottenham, while Levy is believed to pocket £6million-per-year - making him the highest paid Premier League chief executive.</p><h2>BEST NEGOTIATOR</h2><p>It's no secret in football that Levy drives a hard bargain.</p><p>If he has a star asset, he will ensure they either stay or rivals will have to pay more than the going amount to secure their services.</p><p>Just ask Harry Kane, who this summer was embroiled in a huge transfer saga with Manchester City.</p><p>Levy wasn't satisfied with the offers on the table, holding firm on his £150million valuation and managed to keep the player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000648768586.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5b056137-3131-4ca9-9a68-480aa28a0ca5.jpg><p>Better still, in getting Conte as his new manager he might just have played the trump card in convincing Kane to stay for the long term.</p><p>But back in 2008, Manchester United's relentless pursuit of Dimitar Berbatov saw the Red Devils pay £30m for the Bulgarian.</p><p>Quite brilliantly, Sir Alex Ferguson said afterwards that dealing with Levy was "more painful than my hip replacement".</p><p>Levy kept European powerhouse Real Madrid waiting on a deal for Bale, right up until the closing hours of deadline day, as Los Blancos had to cough up a world record £85m fee to nab the Welshman.</p><p>The best compliment, however, might just have come from Lyon's notoriously difficult president Jean-Michel Aulas, who sold goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to Spurs&nbsp;in 2012.</p><p>“The negotiation with the Tottenham directors has been the hardest I have ever had to undergo in 25 years," Aulas said at the time.</p><p>"We had people speaking all night with Daniel Levy.</p><p>“He talks a lot and goes back on what we’ve agreed in writing.”</p><p>For many reasons, Levy has been labelled as football's best negotiator. But the man himself doesn't see it like that.</p><p>"Best negotiator? I think that’s just false. There’s no such thing," he told the <a href=#>Evening Standard</a> in a rare interview in 2019.</p><p>"You can be good, fair, hard. I don’t think anyone can define themselves as the best. I can’t help what other people say, but all I am doing is trying to become a bigger club and I am just protecting my assets."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000608940651.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000653986027.jpg><h2>NEW STADIUM</h2><p>Back in April 2019, Son&nbsp;Heung-min and Co walked out at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first time.</p><p>Not only was it well-received by supporters, many pundits called the epic 62,000 seater arena one of the best in the world.</p><p>Levy's obsession with getting it right was recounted by the project's architect, Chris Lee, who was supposed to visit around 300 stadiums around the globe with the chairman for inspiration.</p><p>"Daniel is one of the most demanding clients I have ever had," Lee told the <a href=#>Independent</a>.</p><p>"Certainly, he is a perfectionist and it was a challenge trying to get perfection. I quickly stopped travelling with him because he never sleeps.</p><p>"We would arrive somewhere at two in the morning, talk for a few hours, then he would say ‘we have a meeting in three hours’. After a few of these trips I quickly stopped. It has been a great experience, trying to strive for perfection."</p><p>There were reports hands-on Levy would monitor the stadium construction via video and zoom in on parts that were unfinished or weren't working to specification, and he would want to know why.</p><p>Then there was the roof, which also didn't escape his attention for detail.</p><p>"We wanted glass and everyone said it wasn’t possible," Levy explained.</p><p>"So we found a solution, so this roof will look brand new in five years’ time. If you go to any other stadium, in five years that definitely wouldn’t be the case."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000423755865.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/c4ea1c34-a44d-4ed1-ac39-f65c586a5d24.jpg><h2>GETTING PERSONAL</h2><p>When it comes to the press, Levy is a closed book.</p><p>Famously, as Louis Van Gaal claimed, he hid in a boot of a car after leaving the Dutchman's home when they held talks about the Spurs job in 2014.</p><p>And when it comes to his personal life, that's certainly kept very private.</p><p>He reportedly has a holiday home in Boca Raton, Florida and divides his time between there and London.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>He is married to his former PA, Tracy Dixon and they have four children, Joshua, Oliver, Chloe and Gabriella.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>But, it's his 20-year marriage to Spurs that we know more about.</p><p>Now, with a manager who knows how to win things at the helm, this fan might just get to see what all Tottenham supporters want... a side that's challenging for honours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3058e628-d24b-4714-b782-deb6961aa427.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000473099982.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Tottenham to offer Harry Kane massive £100k a week pay-rise after denying wantaway striker Man City transfer</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH53gpFqb3BtX6m8tcDEp5%2BapV2Zrq%2B1xKVkpZ2mrnq1u9Sgn2amlZy8tbXAraarZZGjwbC6yKhknKeeqbJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-doug-stone-dating-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Doug Stone Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicole-sherbiny-is-absolutely-miserable-in-a-burkini-does-it-anyway-to-please-mahmoud.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicole Sherbiny is Absolutely Miserable in a Burkini, Does It Anyway to Please Mahmoud</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
