The tournament lasted six days and included many aspects that challenged a soldier’s mental and physical limitations, such as small weapons qualifications, terrain navigation, and obstacle courses.</p><p>Young K triumphed against 49 US and KATUSA troops competing for the title of Best Warrior. The Best Warrior and Squad Competition for the 2022 Eighth Army Competition were conducted from May 8 to May 13. The results were just published, and the You Were Beautiful singer was chosen as Best Warrior.</p><h2>Young K of DAY6 talks about earning Best Warrior as a KATUSA soldier.</h2><p>Young K, a member of JYP Entertainment’s band DAY6, made news when he announced his intention to join the KATUSA. The singer became the first K-pop star to serve in the highly coveted KATUSA, a component of the Republic of Korea army that deploys South Korean troops to US army locations.&nbsp;The Zombie vocalist, who also works as a bassist, rapper, and composer and has over 149 song credits on KOMCA, has won Army’s Best Warrior 2022 after participating in arduous tests against 49 US and KATUSA troops.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Young-K-2.jpg alt="Young K" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Some of the activities that the troops were assessed on included an eight-mile march, survival abilities, and knot-tying evaluations.&nbsp;Speaking to Stars and Stripes, an American military news site, about the tournament, the K-pop star said that a non-commissioned officer pushed him to partake in the events back in April. He made the decision to participate the same night he talked with the officer.&nbsp;The K-pop singer also discussed his military aspirations, stating that one of his goals while completing his mandatory service was to get healthy.</p><p>“That night, I made a choice. Since my sole aim in the Army was to have a healthier physique, to create a better one, because I didn’t take care of [it] previously.”</p><p>Despite his victory, the K-pop star spoke about the difficulties he endured and his inadequacies.</p><p>“There were some glitches.” There were moments when I was on the verge of collapsing, but being able to overcome my limitations… gave me greater confidence in myself — believing in myself — and believing that I, too, can achieve other things.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Young-K-3.jpg alt="Young K" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The DAY6 member also mentioned the honour of serving as a KATUSA soldier. For a variety of reasons, the KATUSA branch is widely wanted.&nbsp;According to a November 2021 story in The Korea Herald, life is a little simpler for KATUSA troops. They may leave their postings on weekdays; unlike previous conscriptions, troops normally reside in couples or alone, leaving no potential for hazing and abuse (a rampant part of military service).&nbsp;Getting into a KATUSA branch is also difficult. Draftees must pass one of many English language examinations. Following the testing, KATUSA selects a number of troops using a lottery mechanism.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiwqK2enHqsec6fZJ2ZqWKDbsPOp2StoJVisLC6056qrWWRnK6qutKtZG1xXarAbq3NnWSkmaSqwKJ50qijnaGVp8Bw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adrienne-banfield-norris-19531018-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adrienne Banfield-Norris (Family Member) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; Mo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-mario-addison-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Mario Addison Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
