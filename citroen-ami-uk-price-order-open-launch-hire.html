It’s the perfect little runabout, for people who don’t need a big, heavy, expensive car.</p><p>Priced from around £6,000, the Ami is technically a quadricycle, which means it’s not quite as safe nor as capable as a normal car.</p><p>And with a top speed of just under 30mph you’re unlikely to be going on big road trips.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you only ever drive around town, this little electric vehicle is an efficient, eco-friendly tool for people who don’t need the world to see them in a BMW.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><h2><strong>Citroen Ami order books open</strong></h2><p>Over a thousand people - 1,100 and counting - have put their name (and £250) down to secure one of these curious little motors, with plenty more expected to rent or lease one when they become more widely available.&nbsp;</p><p>An expected price of around £6,000 - roughly equivalent to the car’s cost in its native France - makes this one of the cheapest cars you can buy new.</p><p>Though anyone who wants to travel on main roads would be better off buying a second-hand hatchback, which will be a more capable vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>That £6,000 price tag is comparable to that of a motorbike, with a representative 500cc like Honda’s CB500X costing around the same.</p><h2><strong>Hire a Citroen Ami by the hour</strong></h2><p>The car was designed as an urban mobility solution as much as a car to own yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Citroen’s vision is for <a href=#>the Ami to be hired by the minute</a>, like you would a Santander Cycle or a dockless scooter.&nbsp;</p><p>This reduces reliance on car ownership while enabling people in towns and cities to drive when they need to, for example when it’s raining or if they have luggage.&nbsp;</p><p>Citroen will also make the Ami available to lease on a longer-term basis. But could it be your next car?</p><p>There are obvious shortcomings, the top speed being one of them. It’s limited to 45km/h, which is around 28mph. That means you’ll be doing 2mph under the speed limit in many British towns.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also very basic, with clever cost-saving details throughout that set it apart from most mainstream cars.&nbsp;</p><p>And it lacks mod cons like a radio, satellite navigation system, and advanced climate control.</p><p>In France, this kind of basic car can be driven by 14-year-olds, and people who - for whatever reason - do not have a full driving licence.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the UK, you need a full licence, which means it competes with the perfectly decent nearly-new hatchbacks you can buy for around the same price.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Whether you want to spend £6,000 on a small plastic car, or the same on a two-year-old <a href=#>Vauxhall Corsa</a>, depends on your lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p>But thanks to a low purchase price and the possibility of hiring one of these for short trips, you can expect to see plenty of these on British roads next year.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Citroen’s 28mph Ami all-electric is cute, quirky and doesn't break the bank</span><h2>We pay for your stories!</h2><h4>Do you have a story for The Sun Online Money team?</h4><p>Email us at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">money@the-sun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxygpJubHFqZWSwqsDRqJynZZGitm7Bymanq6GTmnqwvsOeqWanoJq7brjArqWcoF2dtrOxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristin-kreuk-fled-nxivm-sex-cult-allison-mack-couldnt-be-saved.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Allison Mack Stayed On Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./world-cup-england-women-husbands-partners.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet the BAPs cheering on Englands Lionesses at World Cup final - including German keeper w</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
