She knows her platform can help other people too and she wants to represent as many young women like her as she can.</p><p>“This is about stepping out from a band and defining who she is going to be as an independent woman and as an artist going forwards. She’s very excited at the prospect of working on it and getting it out to fans.”</p><p>Little Mix will shortly head out on the road for their final run of tour dates as a band — at least for now — and are expected to go out with a bang in their final performances of more than a decade of hits which has seen them become the most successful girl group of their generation.</p><p>Each of the remaining three members are in the process of mapping out their future career plans, combining solo music with film and TV<br>projects, fashion and other ideas.</p><p>Former bandmate <a href=#>Jesy Nelson</a> has already begun releasing music alone, while pals Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirwall are currently negotiating their own new contracts to develop as solo artists.</p><p>A pal adds: “Leigh-Anne has a pretty clear vision of where she wants things to go after the band. She’s signed with a very established and successful management company, got a great record deal, appeared in the movie Boxing Day, alongside an all-black cast, and co-hosted the Mobo Awards — all just a few months after becoming a mum for the first time.</p><p>“She’s loved being in the band and has great memories of their experiences, but she’s definitely ready to step out on her own.”</p><p>With the right team behind her and a lorry-load of drive and ambition, you wouldn’t bet against her killing it alone.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><h2 class=has-text-align-center id=lizzo-going-for-gold>Lizzo going for gold</h2><p>LIZZO took a shine to this metallic bikini while on a sun-drenched break with pals.</p><p>She shared the racy snap on Instagram with the caption: “Back to work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000717294830.jpg><p><a href=#>Lizzo</a>’s fourth album is out this year and she said: “It’s one of the most musically daring and sophisticated bodies of work I’ve done.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center id=mark-and-michelle-are-a-perfect-match>Mark and Michelle are a perfect match</h2><p>MICHELLE Keegan and Mark Wright looked the perfect pair in these co-ordinated blue outfits while on a stroll in Los Angeles.</p><p><a href=#>The couple </a>have been making the most of their break in LA, dropping into celebrity restaurant Craig’s for a posh night out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/9afa4958-79c1-4915-9a61-5c36649520e8.jpg><p>They have gone all out for the jaunt too, staying at a £26,000-a-week villa overlooking the Hollywood Hills.</p><p>If they weren’t building their own mega mansion in Essex I’d advise them to stay across the pond.</p><p>With views like that every day, I would never want to leave.</p><p>And no, I’m not just talking about Michelle…</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center id=grimmy-heads-home>Grimmy heads home</h2><p>NICK Grimshaw has ditched plans to move to LA.</p><p><a href=#>The ex-Radio 1 DJ </a>checked out California at the start of the year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000676742478.jpg><p>But asked in an exclusive chat if a move was on the cards he admitted: “Not really.
