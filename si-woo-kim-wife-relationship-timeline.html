She tied the knot with golfer Si Wook Kim in December 2022.</strong></p><p>The South Korean professional golfer, Si Wook Kim, began his professional golf journey in 2012.</p><p>Since his debut, Si Woo has won four PGA Tour with his latest coming earlier this year in Sony Open.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/si-woo-kim-wife-ji-hyun-oh.jpg><p>The victory was a long time coming for Si Woo, who celebrated it alongside his supportive wife. His first victory after his wedding, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that lady luck propelled him to the win.&nbsp;</p><p>Ranked 40th in the world, the South Korean golfer is only behind Hideki Matsuyama and KJ Choi when it comes to most wins by an Asian golfer with the most wins on Tour.&nbsp;</p><p>He is currently competing in Wells Fargo Championship alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>Akshay Bhatia</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Tommy Fleetwood</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Si Woo Kim Wife, Ji Hyun Oh, Is A Professional Golfer</h2><p>Si Woo Kim’s wife, Ji Hyun Oh, was once the most talked about female golfer in South Korea.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in November 1996, Ji Hyun Oh turned professional in 2014, two years after her husband.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/si-woo-kim.jpg><p>Unlike other rookie golfers at the time, Ji Hyun Oh went directly from the amateur ranks to LPGA, skipping past the developmental leagues.</p><p>And right after her debut, the media nicknamed her “Yuna Kim of the KLPGA,” sharing a striking resemblance with the Olympic Figure Sakting Gold Medalist of the same name.</p><h3>Ji Hyun Oh And Her Rise In KLPGA</h3><p>After her debut in 2014, Oh, achieved her first victory at the end of the 2015 season. She finished 17th on the money list and only continued to improve a year later.&nbsp;</p><p>Her breakthrough season came in 2017, as she finished third on the money list and achieved two more career wins. It was also the year Ji Hyun won her first Major at the Hanwha Classic.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, Oh got a strong start, finishing runner-up in two competitions, winning her second major, Korea’s Women’s Open, and finishing third on the money list again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ji-hyun-oh-klpga.jpg><p>But since 2018, Ji Hyun Oh’s career has stalled. She faced several injuries in 2019, putting her out of many competitions, and had only three top tens. She improved in 2020, but only by a few margins.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, Ji Hyun Oh won her first tournament in three years at the Samdasoo Masters and hinted that maybe 2022 would bring more success. But unfortunately, Ji Hyun Oh didn’t participate much in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Media in South Korea believe Ji Hyun Oh has taken a break from golf and is focused on her married life with Si Woo Kim. Some even believe she has retired, but only time will tell whether Ji Hyun will return to the KLPGA golf scene.&nbsp;</p><h2>Si Woo Kim Married Life With Wife Ji Hyun Oh</h2><p>Si Woo Kim and Ji Hyun Oh, the two South Korean golfers, exchanged their vows in 2022.</p><p>Before tying the knot, Si Woo and Ji Hyun became <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram </a>official on May 9, 2021. The golfer, Si Woo Kim, shared an elevator selfie of them, hinting something was brewing between them. Ji Hyun reshared the same picture a day later on her Instagram.</p><p>Since then, the couple didn’t shy away from displaying their affection for each other on social media. The dotting boyfriend even shared a picture of Ji Hyun holding her Samdasoo Masters trophy, congratulating her on the win.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple kick-started 2022 with a trip to Waikiki Beach, Hawaii. A month later, in February, the golfing couple also enjoyed watching the Lakers at the Crytp.com arena.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/si-woo-kim-married.jpg><p>But in July 2022, Ji Hyun dropped the big news about her wedding to Si Woo. The KLPGA golfer shared a series of pictures from her surprise bridal shower arranged by a few of her friends.&nbsp;</p><p>In October 2022, Si Woo caddied his partner during a competition receiving a major highlight in their country. And finally, their wedding date came on December 18, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple shared a series of stunning pictures of their wedding ceremony on their Instagram handle, with both looking flawless in several of their posts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During an interview, Si Woo said he had never been more nervous in life than he was on his wedding day. It was far more nerve-wracking than playing golf as a PGA player.&nbsp;</p><p>Si Woo added that he believes his wife’s experience as a golf player will help their relationship to excel as she understands the stress and pressure one needs to deal with.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, in the Masters’ Tournament, Ji Hyun Oh caddied her husband and ended up scoring a better tee shot than him. The cute husband, Si Woo, recorded the entire ordeal from the background, which they shared with high fives.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC%2FyGauqKddoLauedainZ5lopq5osDIqKWsoJmlerW1zJ6joqaVZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miley-cyrus-adore-you-music-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miley Cyrus - &amp;quot;Adore You&amp;quot; (Music Video)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jen-bretty.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jen Bretty Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
