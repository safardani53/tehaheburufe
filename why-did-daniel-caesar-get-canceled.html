With a Grammy win and a Billboard chart-topping feature under his belt, it's clear that others have taken notice of Daniel's musical talents over the years. However, his time in the spotlight hasn't been entirely without controversy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Case in point: a situation in 2019 where Daniel got himself in some hot water with members of the Black community. So, what do we know about that situation and if Daniel was canceled or not? Furthermore, has he apologized for any statements he has made?

Let's break down the situation.</h2><p>During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Live session</a> on March 19, 2019, the singer defended social media star YesJulz after a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshot</a> surfaced of an old tweet in which she shared an image of a shirt that read "N----s lie a lot" alongside the caption "So ... am I allowed to wear this at the festival tomorrow or nah."</p><p>Furthermore, he condemned members of the Black community for attacking her over her race.</p><p>"Why are we being so mean to Julz?" he said at the time. "Why are we being so mean to white people right now? That’s a serious question. Why is it that we’re allowed to be disrespectful and rude to everybody else and when anybody returns any type of energy to us. That’s not equality. I don’t wanna be treated like I can’t take a joke."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Daniel added, "White people have been mean to us in the past, yeah, but what are you going to do about it? Tell me what you’re going to do about that. There’s no answer, other than creating and understanding and keeping it moving. You have to bridge that gap."</p><p>He then challenged the Black community to "cancel" him. Recourse was swift, with Daniel's 2019 sophomore album sales taking a hit.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Has Daniel Caesar apologized for his comments?</h2><p>Just days after sharing his thoughts in 2019, Daniel went on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Live</a> again and apologized to fans. "I was talking down to you guys. I apologize for how I expressed my idea," he said.</p><p>In 2023, ahead of the release of his third album, Daniel was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewed</a> by Apple Music and addressed his controversial comments once again.</p><p>"I completely understand the response, and in time, after taking time to get over myself and to really honestly look at myself and everything that was happening," he shared. "I was wrong. I was wrong, and I’m sorry about that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ackaO2priMnJieq5Gneqix02aamqaTmrmmsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aaron-fraser-nash-19870418-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aaron Fraser-Nash (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paige-taylor-tiktok-ban-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Former Hype House Member Paige Taylor?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
