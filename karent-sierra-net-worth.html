Karent spends time helping celebrity patients with their teeth issues, and she earns a pretty penny for it. Celebrities are probably very picky about who they choose to be their dentist since they need total confidentiality and privacy with their medical records. Plenty of celebrities trust Karent to get the job done in a professional manner.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Karent Sierra</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Reality TV star, singer, and dentist</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $400,000</p><p>Karent Sierra is a reality TV star, singer, and dentist.</p><p><strong>Birth name: </strong>Karent Sierra</p><p><strong>Birthdate: </strong>Jan. 26, 1974</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>New York City, N.Y.</p><p><strong>Relationship: </strong>Single</p><p><strong>Education: </strong>Undisclosed<strong> </strong>dental school in Wisconsin</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Karent is a well-established cosmetic dentist who works at an office in Coral Gables, Fla. Her dental practice is considered upscale and high-end with massage chairs, headphones, flat screens, and personal iPods patients can utilize while receiving dental services.

This is a huge reason Karent stands out among the competition.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram @KarentSierra</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Karent also added to her net worth when she appeared as a full-time housewife on the second season of Bravo's The Real Housewives of Miami. Though the second season of the Miami franchise didn't do too well with the ratings (and Karent was demoted to a friend role in Season 3 in 2013), housewives, on average, tend to make anywhere between five and six figures per episode.</p><p>When the show returned for a fourth season reboot on Peacock in 2021, Karent's name was left off the cast list. Fans, therefore, may be wondering what else she's been up to since her time on the 305 series ended (and what her net worth is now).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here are more details about Karent Sierra's net worth.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Karent currently has a net worth of $400,000 thanks to her dental career, reality TV career, acting career, modeling career, and work as a spokesperson for Colgate Toothpaste.

On her Instagram, Karent shares a link to a foundation called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharing Smiles</a> that she’s connected to. She encourages her fans and followers to donate money so that underprivileged children in both Miami Dade County and in Kenya are able to receive dental care.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram @KarentSierra</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The foundation also helps children living in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and India.
