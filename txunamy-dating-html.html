On top of it, Txunamy herself has also gathered a massive fan following, with over 4.7 million followers on her Instagram alone.</p><p>She frequently posts on her social media and has also recently started appearing in other projects. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In March 2022, Txunamy starred in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube video</a> titled ‘High School GIRL Gets A BOYFRIEND, She Instantly Regrets It,’ which was uploaded on the LOVE XO channel. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The channel uploads several videos that focus on stories of teens and what they go through in high school. Txunamy’s parents <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reacted</a> to the video and uploaded it to their family channel to show their support for their daughter.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The video's title was ‘Txunamy Gets Her First Boyfriend And Instantly Regrets It ft Familia Diamond.’ Because of it, many of the channel’s subscribers and Txunamy’s fans began wondering if she finally got herself a boyfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It doesn’t surprise the family channel’s longtime subscribers, as they had done multiple videos on the topic, including several pranks.</p><h2>Who Is Txunamy Dating?</h2><p>Though the Familia Diamond channel contains several videos suggesting Txunamy having a boyfriend, it’s revealed that she isn’t in any relationships by the end of all those videos.</p><p>However, while Txunamy has dated no one, she has had a “secret admirer” who is similarly a <a href=# rel=follow>YouTuber</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Biggy from the Norris Nuts family has been very open about having a crush on Txunamy in the past, and several videos about it can be found on their Norris Nuts Do Stuff channel.</p><p>Back in 2019, Biggy <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sent a package</a> for Txunamy that contained a box of her favorite chocolates, a card, and a pair of earrings.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Biggy pasted his picture on a card and wrote "boy" before friend to profess his love.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He had also pasted his picture on the card, which read, “everything’s more fun with a friend….” Biggy had also written “Boy” with a black marker in front of the word friend.</p><p>Txunamy and her mother were very excited about the package and expressed their happiness at it. Her father, on the other hand, was vehemently opposed to the idea of his daughter dating.</p><p>He could also be seen coming in between his daughter and the contents of the package, insisting that the things inside were meant for him and not Txunamy.</p><h2>Txunamy & Biggy</h2><p>Biggy having a crush on Txunamy was known to members of both families. In fact, both the channels had made several contents with the matter at its center.</p><p>In one <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">particular video</a> where Biggy’s sisters pranked him about Txunamy having a boyfriend, he noted that while he would be hurt if she had a partner, he would still be happy for her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Biggy also speculated frequently that if Txunamy had a boyfriend, it would be Addison Rae’s brother. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When asked about how much he liked Txunamy, Biggy said on a scale of one to ten, with ten being how much married couples loved each other, he liked Txunamy a solid nine or nine and a half.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyoqruiudhmm5qsmaO0b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-john-indrizzi-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Was John Indrizzi?
