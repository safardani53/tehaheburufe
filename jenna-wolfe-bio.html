Alongside her anchoring duties, the NBC reporter makes time for fitness and works as a fitness expert as a side hustle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jenna-1-768x1024.jpg><p>In like manner, Wolfe weighs a proper <strong>58</strong> <strong>kg</strong> (127.8 lbs) and maintains her physique and weight through exercise.</p><p>Her body measurements include 37-inches of breast, 26-inches of waist, and 36-inches of hips.</p><p>Further, Jenna possesses a leaner frame with a muscular layer, stands at the height of <strong>5’7″</strong> (<strong>1.68</strong> <strong>m</strong>), and has an incredible presence amongst her colleagues.</p><p>Apart from this, Wolfe also owns a set of brown eyes, medium-length straight hair, and a broad smile to compliment her beautiful looks.</p><h2>Jenna Wolfe | Career: Anchor & Fitness Expert | What Is Jenna Wolfe Doing These Days?</h2><p>To begin with, the Jamaican embarked on journalism in 1996 with a job at <strong>WICZ</strong>, a FOX network affiliate.
