Our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies go to Mr and Mrs Kiernan and Kaye for their tragic loss.</p><p>“Sonny was a lively, outgoing pupil with a warm smile and a great sense of humour.</p><p>“He made a whole-hearted contribution to the school community, bringing infectious enthusiasm to lessons and activities.</p><p>“We shall always remember him as a cheerful boy who brightened our lives.”</p><p>The tributes to Sonny — who lived with Ford, 51, Lesley, 44, and Kaye in Glasgow’s West End — came as harrowing details emerged about his death.</p><p>The tragedy came shortly after Kiernan tweeted he was watching Channel 4 documentary Secrets of the Living Dolls, which started at 10pm on Monday.</p><p>Just half-an-hour after the programme ended, the schoolboy’s lifeless body was found.</p><p>Medics battled to revive the youngster after he was rushed to Yorkhill<br>Hospital — but he could not be saved.</p><p>Showbiz stars also paid their respects to the tragic youngster on social media.</p><p>River City favourite Tom Urie, who starred alongside Kiernan on legendary sketch show Chewin’ The Fat, wrote on Twitter: “Thoughts and prayers are with Ford, Lesley and Kaye.”</p><p>Paul James Corrigan, best known as Shieldinch cheeky chappie Stevie Burns, wrote: “Horrible, sad news. My thoughts and prayers are with Ford and his family.”</p><p>And Jordan Young — who plays businessman Alex McAllister in the BBC soap — said: “Such horrific news for Ford and his family. My thoughts are with them.”</p><p>Comedy legend Andy Cameron wrote: “Dreadful news about Sonny Kiernan. My thoughts are with Ford and his family. Sometimes this life is impossible to understand. RIP Sonny.”</p><p>Gary: Tank Commander creator Greg McHugh, 33, wrote on Twitter: “Shocked having just learned of Ford Kiernan’s loss. The worst news imaginable.”</p><p>TV comic Brian Limond, creator of BBC Scotland’s Limmy’s Show, told followers:<br>“That is very sad news about Ford Kiernan’s son. My thoughts are with his family.”</p><p>DJ and Scottish Sun columnist Robin Galloway added: “It’s utterly heartbreaking.”</p><p>And actress Kathleen McDermott wrote: “My thoughts and prayers are with Ford Kiernan and his family at this very sad time.”</p><p>Yesterday, distraught Kiernan came to the door of the family home but was too upset to talk.</p><p>A florist arrived at the £600,000 property — where the blinds were drawn all day — to deliver bouquets. One neighbour, a former Kelvinside Academy teacher, said: “In all the years I taught, this kind of thing never happened. It’s one of those terribly sad things. It’s every parent’s worst<br>nightmare. A real tragedy.”</p><p>Another neighbour, a woman in her 40s, added: “It’s unbelievable. I feel really sorry for the family.”</p><p>There was no answer yesterday at the home of Lesley’s parents Malcolm and<br>Ellen Stewart, both 74. But flowers had been placed on their doorstep in<br>Rutherglen, near Glasgow.</p><p>There was also no sign of Kiernan’s mum Frances, 73, or sister Tracey, 46, at their flat in Dennistoun. Police confirmed they were treating Sonny’s death as “unexplained”. A spokeswoman said: “At 11.30pm on Monday we received a report of the death of a 12-year-old boy in Kelvinside. A post mortem will be held to establish the exact cause of death.”</p><p>Telly favourite Kiernan shot to fame with Greg Hemphill in Chewin’ The Fat.</p><p>But they are best known for playing wise-cracking OAPs Jack and Victor in spin-off sitcom Still Game. Last year, the duo announced a return in a<br>series of live shows to be held at the Hydro Arena in Glasgow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaYV5hZRrZqysmaG5brPAppxmnp%2BnsbR50qilZpuYpLimsIytpmaclZbBqXmRaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shailey-colliers-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Shailey Collier Dating Shailey Collier's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-matthews.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jack Matthews</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
