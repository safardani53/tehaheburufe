a gray 2022 BMW SUV near the area of Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, the Daytona Beach Police Department said.</p><p>Authorities said they feared Bell was "missing and endangered."</p><p>Bell was soon <a href=#>found unharmed</a> in Orange County at around 11.30am, the Orange County Sheriff's Office confirmed to The U.S. Sun.</p><p>Little information surrounding the circumstances of Bell's brief disappearance has been revealed as of yet.</p><p>However, the actor and musician shared a shocking story with his fans in his <a aria-label="latest video (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">latest video</a> on <a href=#>YouTube</a> weeks before the missing report was issued.</p><p>The 36-year-old told viewers that he almost died in a car crash during filming for the popular Nickelodeon <a href=#>television</a> series Drake & Josh.</p><p>"I Almost Died on Drake & Josh!" the <a href=#>celebrity</a> captioned the clip.</p><p>Bell appeared at the beginning of the video with just his guitar strung over his shoulder and went into gory details about the 2006 accident.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><h2>CLOSE CALL</h2><p>The actor, 19 at the time, explained that he and a friend ventured to Zuma Beach to run and were on their way to Santa Monica for food when they decided to go home and change first.</p><p>Parked at a stoplight and turning left, <a href=#>a car</a> hit him and his friend head-on going "full speed," per Bell.</p><p>Bell claimed he remained conscious as the vehicle spun and hit a fence while he lost several teeth and suffered a broken jaw from slamming his face on the steering wheel of the car.</p><p>The actor even received a laceration to his chin, which he said he could stick his tongue through.</p><p>After being transported to the <a href=#>hospital</a> via ambulance, Bell noted that first responders allegedly dropped him off at the wrong location.</p><p>"Finally, some nurses came by and picked up my chart and looked at the clipboard and realized, 'Oh, you're at the wrong hospital,'" he recalled.</p><p>He was then transferred over to the correct location, where he allegedly had "7,000 stitches" placed in his chin by an on-call surgeon to sow up the laceration wound.</p><p>Later that day, he underwent surgery for his broken jaw, which was wired shut for some time.</p><p>Bell noted that almost the entire cast and crew from Drake & Josh showed up after the ordeal.</p><p>Either way, the video discussing <a href=#>the accident</a> wasn't the only intriguing content the actor made before vanishing.</p><h2>'GET AWAY'</h2><p>As The U.S. Sun <a href=#>previously reported</a>, Bell appeared on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Creativo podcast</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;YouTuber&nbsp;Roberto Mtz and discussed his entire career up until this point, along with his new album.</p><p>Bell even discussed the car accident once again, claiming that the injury still affects him to this day and ultimately impacted his future roles once Drake & Josh ended.</p><p>The actor also explained his frustrations with fame and even talked about separating himself from it.</p><p>"Sometimes you just wanna...sometimes you just wanna go away and get away from everything," Bell said.</p><p>"That's actually what a lot of my new album is about. It's about being fed up with <a href=#>Hollywood</a> and what it's done to myself and people I see."</p><p>Although there has been no confirmation of these comments being related to Bell's recent disappearance, the actor has dealt with a share of difficult situations in his career.</p><p>He has come into trouble with the law <a href=#>on attempted child endangerment</a> and <a href=#>pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct</a> in July 2021.</p><p>After being found on Thursday, Bell will now undergo a <a href=#>mental health</a> evaluation as recommended by Orange County deputies.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>This comes despite claims that the actor appeared fine on Tuesday when he was spotted at Seaworld in <a href=#>Orlando</a> with his son, Jeremy, according to what a witness told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>.</p><p>They allegedly approached Bell to tell him they were a fan and said the actor responded in a "nice and soft-spoken manner."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/2019-iheartradio-music-awards-broadcasted-809673796.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaGuGdHyYaJurmZuaeqOxy6VkrKCfmLhur8uaoKZllK62r7OMr6CdnZ9iuqq%2F0qKloGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kian-lawley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kian Lawley Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dale-earnhardt-jr-responds-blame-wife-retirement.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Dale EarnhardtJr. Says Wife Amy Is Not Why He Retired</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
