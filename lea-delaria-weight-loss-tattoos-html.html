The Belleville, Illinois native has always embraced her body, so her sudden need to lose weight could come as a surprise to some.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>There is a reasonable explanation, though. DeLaria was compelled to lose weight because of her diabetes diagnosis. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;But how serious was it? And how did the actress successfully lose so much weight in so little time? In this article, we will delve deeper into her health and attempt to find out.</p><h2>Lea DeLaria has Always Embraced Her Body</h2><p>DeLaria is often called “Butch” for her masculine build, but she has no nickname problem. One of her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tattoos</a>&nbsp;even spells out the word, showing how much she embraces the title. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She is also known for appreciating her body,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">calling herself</a>&nbsp;a “Proud Fat woman.” The actress has always been seen as a confident self-accepting woman and a figure of inspiration by many. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Talking To EOnline during the period when she had already adopted a &nbsp;diabetes-friendly diet post-2014, she emphasized the importance of channeling inner beauty and bashed Hollywood’s obsession with thinness.</p><p>"When I lecture at universities I always say, 'Look, I got laid just as much as I did when I was 50 lbs. heavier than I am right now.' So, frankly, you're beautiful no matter what your size is...This obsession we have with thinness in our industry and in the world needs to [go away]," DeLaria said to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">EOnline</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>DeLaria Was Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in 2014</h2><p>Since DeLaria always embraced her body, her weight was never an issue until she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">September 2014</a>. She previously had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ignored symptoms&nbsp;</a>for years, passing them off as menopause since she was in her mid-50s.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I had all the symptoms of diabetes — frequent urination the middle of the night, feeling like I had no energy — but those are also symptoms of menopause...I just thought I was doing the menopause thing, but it lasted for almost a decade.</p><p>Her diabetes was quite serious, though; in an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with self.com</a>, De Laria said she could have even died from it.</p><p>“It was a good thing I went to a doctor; you know I knocked, knock, knocking on death’s door.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>knocked, knock, knocking on death’s door.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Diabetes Forced Lea DeLaria to Change her Eating Habits</h2><p>DeLaria claimed that she didn’t slack off at all after she found out she had diabetes. Instead, she completely changed her diet, focusing only on proteins and vegetables.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Yahoo Life</a>&nbsp;in May 2020, she admitted she used to eat “anything [she] wanted” before being diagnosed. After diagnosis, though, she did everything to eat healthily. Her diet changed from “anything” to one that had lots of protein and green vegetables.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I completely changed the way I eat. You won’t see me eating a lot of toast, and potatoes are special foods.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In the beginning,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DeLaria</a>&nbsp;found it hard to adopt a healthy diet. The medicines she took for diabetes prohibited her from even having an appetite.&nbsp;</p><p>One: I have no appetite. Two: When I finally do get an appetite, I take two bites of it. Three: Anything I eat comes right out again because of the medication...My fiancée is like, 'You're living my dream!' It ain't my dream—I'd rather eat a steak, let's be honest.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>A Simple Change in Diet & Regular Excercise Helped a Lot in Her Weight Loss&nbsp;</h2><p>Changing her diet definitely showed its result, and by April 2015,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DeLaria had lost 50 pounds</a>&nbsp;in less than six months.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In a 2018<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;interview with self.com</a>, she claimed that her total weight loss was 60 pounds reducing her weight to 170 pounds. She attributed all of this to healthy eating habits, regular exercise, and diabetes medication. She also said that her blood sugar level was comparable to a normal person then, even though her diabetes was chronic.</p><p>Also, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">competed</a> with her diabetic brother in controlling their respective diabetes. The fact that diabetes ran in her family hadn't bothered <a href=# rel=follow>DeLaria</a> until she was diagnosed with it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>When my brother was diagnosed with diabetes, I was making fun of him, going, ‘Ha ha. You have to watch what you eat and I can eat whatever I want...Then, I had to call him and go, ‘Well, I got it too...Sibling rivalry really helped me take care of my diabetes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>DeLaria is an Avid Advocate of Body Positivity and part of LGBT Community</h2><p>DeLaria has repeatedly emphasized that her weight loss was purely due to health reasons and not for her figure. She is big on body positivity and frequently advocates for LGBT rights too.</p><p>Her acceptance of her body and her sexuality is a big part of that. One of her many tattoos&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">is a Greek signal</a>&nbsp;showing that she is a lesbian. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6GyonnDnqOaqpmWerixyKCfrWWcpMC0edOaq62nn6h7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kenan-kel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jill-eikenberry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jill Eikenberry</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
