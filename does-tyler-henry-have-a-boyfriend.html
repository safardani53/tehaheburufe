The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Medium</a> star is in the fourth season of his hit E! show, which documents the 23-year-old giving readings to high-profile celebrity clientele.&nbsp;</p><p>Though he can predict the future and be spot-on when reading other people, Tyler revealed that he has a hard time getting details into his own personal life, specifically when it comes to his relationship. When asked if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler foresaw a wedding </a>in his future, he shared, "I always say, I can tell everybody else's future except my own.” Yes, Tyler does have a steady boyfriend, and his name is Clint Godwin.&nbsp;</p><p>The photographer and medium have been dating for several years and the two initially met through Clint’s mom who was a client of Tyler. "It's been amazing. I've been in a happy little relationship for about a year now and it's really wonderful," Tyler told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>E! News</u></a> in a 2018 interview. "I'm really thankful we get to be open about that and get to live my true self and get to share it with fans."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How does Tyler Henry’s boyfriend handle his psychic abilities?&nbsp;</h2><p>Luckily, Tyler’s boyfriend Clint is not weirded out by his gifts. “I found it actually works really well. It's just a matter of I think finding the right person. One of the beauties of intuition is that if I was interacting with someone that didn't feel right or they were kind of creeped out by what I was able to do, then they clearly weren't the right fit," Tyler explained to the outlet. "And I'm really thankful with Clint, he from the get-go understood this, was open to it and he respects it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Tyler also explained that his gift doesn’t just shut off when he wants it to, and Clint’s deceased relatives will push through.&nbsp;</p><p>"There’s still times where we'll be hanging out at 11 o'clock at night and something will come through from his grandfather or I'll get a message for his family and he understands that I kind of have to get it out so we can go about our evening," he said. “So, it's a little awkward but he understands how I work and when I see something I just have to share it so I can go back to focusing on whatever I was doing."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much does Tyler Henry make per episode of his E! show?&nbsp;</h2><p>Though it is not known how much Tyler Henry makes per episode of his self-titled Hollywood Medium show, Celebrity Net Worth has reported that the popular medium is worth an estimated $3 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from his work on the E! show — which debuted in 2016 — Tyler also wrote a book and has toured around America doing live appearances.&nbsp;</p><p>We predict Tyler and his boyfriend will go the distance!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ytsKWdomK1prrRsmShmaaaeqJ5waiwn6qZmrul</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bill-belichick.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bill Belichick Bio: Early Life, Career &amp;amp; Net Worth [2023 Update]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-daniel-n-durant-from-dancing-with-the-stars.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Daniel N.
