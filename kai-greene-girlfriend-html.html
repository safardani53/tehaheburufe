It was the most romantic weekend I ever had. We were so happy we will never forget it,” said Cadeau.</p><p>As for how Greene differed from the men she dated, Cadeau iterated she had never been in a loving and healthy relationship before, and Greene was everything a woman could ask for.&nbsp;</p><p>She also shared that they had plans to get married one day.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Kai Greene and Dayana Cadeau’s Shared Passion</h2><p>After gushing about Greene, his girlfriend delved into their lives as bodybuilders and how their shared passion brought them closer.&nbsp;</p><p>As bodybuilders, Greene and his girlfriend understood each other and completed each other.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, it was not always easy, but it was something they could overcome with patience and understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, when they were getting ready for shows together, they needed to know how to deal with each other.&nbsp;The couple strived to become the best bodybuilders on the planet, and the motivation for both of them came from loving challenges.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They were also inspired to work harder when they improved because bodybuilders were never satisfied, as Cadeau put it.</p><p>And part of the improvements came from listening to each other. For example, Greene would give Cadeau advice on posing and creatively expressing herself.&nbsp;</p><p>She trusted him wholeheartedly and vice versa, which played a vital role in strengthening their bond.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKORnnqovsSepZ5ll56%2FrbLRopynnF6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./match-highlights-fluminense-vs-corinthians.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Brazil Campeonato Brasileiro Srie A: Fluminense vs. Corinthians</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeong-woo-yeong-all-about-the-professional-football-player-from-south-korea.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeong Woo Yeong- All About The Professional Football Player From South Korea</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
