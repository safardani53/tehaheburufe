It's understood that she was advised to steer away from products containing caffeine while growing up. So, just how far does her insistence on clean eating go? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is she vegan</a>?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bindi and the rest of the Irwin family received some flak for their eating habits in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>According to most sources, they have yet to come out in support of vegetarianism or veganism. While the exact details about their current food preferences are unknown, it's more than likely that they follow a healthy, nutritious diet — that may or may not occasionally feature dishes with meat.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bindi and Chandler Powell released a line of vegan candles when they got married.</h2><p>In a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, Bindi explained that her go-to breakfast is a bowl of brown rice with vegetables.

In no uncertain terms did I research it," Steve told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>"Let's say this represents one cow, which will keep me in food for, let's say, a month. Now that cow needs this much land and food. Well, you can imagine, that cow needs x by x amount of land, and you can grow trees in it. Around that cow, you can have goannas, kangaroos, wallabies. [...]," he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"If I was a vegetarian, to feed me for that month, I need this much land, and nothing else can grow there. Herein lies our problem. If we level that much land to grow rice and whatever, then no other animal could live there except for some insect pest species.
