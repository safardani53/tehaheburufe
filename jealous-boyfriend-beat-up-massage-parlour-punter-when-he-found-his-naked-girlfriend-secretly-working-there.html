violent rampage in a massage parlour after discovering his girlfriend was secretly working there.</strong></p><p>Cristian Barbu, 26, subjected the punter who had “booked” a session with his girlfriend to a 45-minute stop-starting beating during the siege at Passions in Manchester.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000313338709.jpg><p>The unwitting man had locked himself in the room, but “highly emotional” Barbu managed to kick the door down and attack him, Manchester Crown Court heard.</p><p>By this point, Barbu had already assaulted his girlfriend, who had reportedly fled the room naked as soon as she realised he was there, the <a href=#>Manchester Evening News </a>reports.</p><p>Barbu kicked and chased his girlfriend throughout the massage parlour, before dragging her across the corridor by her hair, the court heard.</p><p>Upon entering the parlour, Barbu demanded to see his girlfriend, before ripping out the landline, grabbing the receptionist’s phone, and arming himself with a knife taken from the kitchen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000265668230.jpg><p>He proceeded to terrorise staff at the establishment over the next hour, along with his girlfriend and her client, wearing nothing but his vest.</p><p>The 26-year-old has been jailed for 32 months after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm, common assault, possessing a bladed article and criminal damage in the incident, which took place on May 3 last year.</p><p>He faces deportation to Romania, where he holds convictions for robbery and escape.</p><p>Speaking to the court, prosecutor Craig McGregor said two other women who worked at Passions arrived as the incident was underway.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>One of the women tried to leave the premises, but was pushed back inside by Barbu.</p><p>While hitting and kicking the punter who had been in the room with his partner, the 26-year-old took cigarette breaks.</p><p>He also took time out to kiss the hand of the receptionist, whom he forbid from leaving.</p><p>When a security guard arrived at the scene to disarm Barbu, he bit him on the bicep.</p><p>The siege only ended when the venue’s owner pulled back on one of Barbu’s thumbs, causing him to drop the knife.</p><p>At this stage, he was pinned down by a number of the massage parlour’s workers.</p><p>If there’s anything he could do to recompense the massage parlour he would, but he has no means at all</p><span class=quote-credit>Khadim Al’Hassan</span><p>Khadim Al’Hassan, defending Barbu, who has since remarried and become a father, said: “He admits that what happened was that he lost control - he was in such shock, he simply lost it and couldn’t see clearly at that time.</p><p>“He wishes to be deported back [to Romania and serve his sentence there] – his wife and his child are almost destitute without his income and that causes him immense pain.</p><p>“If there’s anything he could do to recompense the massage parlour he would, but he has no means at all.”</p><p>Sentencing the 26-year-old, Judge Hilary Manley spoke directly to Barbu: “When you discovered the true nature of your girlfriend’s employment you lost control - that loss of control was extremely prolonged.”</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories!
