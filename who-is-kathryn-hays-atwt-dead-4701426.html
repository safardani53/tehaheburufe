The soap opera icon was best known for playing Kim Sullivan on As the World Turns for 38 years. Hays died in Fairfield, CT on March 25, per <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TV Line</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Her longtime on-screen husband <strong>Don Hastings</strong> — known to the audience as Bob Hughes — released a statement after news broke of her passing.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our relationship as Bob and Kim was as close as Kathryn and my relationship, except we were not married,” the 88-year-old actor said. “We were more like brother and sister and we were great friends. Our biggest squabble was that she always wanted to rehearse and I wanted to take a nap. This is a huge loss to all who knew her,” he also said, fondly remembering Kathryn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kathryn-Hays-5-Things-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Learn more about the soap opera legend here.</p><h2><strong><strong>1. She Was On ‘As The World Turns’</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kathryn made her debut on&nbsp;As The World Turns&nbsp;in 1972, and remained in the role of Kim Sullivan for 54 years — until the show ended in 2010.&nbsp;“I always say … it was the longest job I ever had,” she said in 2020, while on YouTube talk show The Locher Room. “Actors never have long jobs like that. I mean, they would play on Broadway a certain amount of times or whatever. But it was the longest job and the best partner I ever had,” Hays said of Hastings during the virtual reunion.” Her longstanding role earned her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2019.</p><h2><span><span><i>2. She was from Illinois</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kathryn was born Kay Piper on July 26, 1933, in Princeton, Illinois but raised in Joliet. As a young woman, she enrolled at the prestigious Northwestern University.</p><h2><span><span><i>3. She was married and had kids</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kathryn’s first marriage was to&nbsp;<strong>Sidney Steinberg</strong> in 1957. The couple welcomed her only daughter Sherri, who went on to marry <strong>Bob Mancusi </strong>as an adult. Hays was also married to <strong>Glenn Ford</strong> from 1966 – 1969, and to <strong>Wolf Lieshke</strong> from 1984 – 1986. Hays is also a grandmother to<strong> Kate</strong>, <strong>Cameron</strong> and <strong>Garrett Wells</strong>, and great grandma to <strong>Jack</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kathryn-Hays-5-Things-SS-embed-2.jpg><h2><span><span><i>4.
