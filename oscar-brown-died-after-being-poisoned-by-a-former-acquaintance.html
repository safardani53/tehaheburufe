The influencer allegedly died on Monday, May 23, in Asaba, Delta State. According to his acquaintances, the content creator died after being poisoned by a former buddy.&nbsp;Following Oscar Brown’s death, his family and friends made the news on social media. A relative of the TikToker announced on Facebook:</p><p>“With heavy hearts, we, the family of EBUKA, popularly known as Oscar Brown, regretfully announce the death of our brother and son, who died on May 23, 2022, after being poisoned by someone.”</p><p>The article further said that people interested in learning more about funeral preparations can call 09090475312 on Whatsapp. The post concluded with:</p><p>“Your assistance is much appreciated…”</p><p>According to sources, this is not the first time the influencer has been poisoned.</p><h2>Investigating the several instances Oscar Brown has been poisoned</h2><p>According to Kemi Filani, they acquired information from Brown’s acquaintance, who said that this is not the first time the influencer has been poisoned. The first effort was a failure. However, the third killed him.&nbsp;Oscar Brown was allegedly hospitalized after his second poisoning. This allegedly occurred at a gathering Brown was attending.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Oscar-Brown-2.jpg alt="Oscar Brown" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Brown’s companion said that this was the third time in three years that he had been poisoned.&nbsp;Prior to his death, he allegedly sent a note to a buddy from his hospital bed that read:</p><p>“I was poisoned again. My foes seem to be practicing on me (their powers). I wasn’t poisoned in the village this time. Last week, I was poisoned during an entertainment event in Abuja. I truly don’t know how I was poisoned since there was a gathering of people, but it wasn’t a large one.”</p><p>He went on:</p><p>“I’m recovering, despite the fact that I haven’t worked out or driven since I became unwell. However, I plan to go for a stroll today (Friday) evening in the hopes of feeling better. I’m eating well now, and I’m ready to go back on set at any time.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the TikToker was killed by the toxin. Kemi Filani posted an image of a WhatsApp message from an unnamed individual that verified his death. “My Manager T” composed the message. It said:</p><p>“I regret to inform you of the death of Oscar Brown, who was poisoned again but did not survive. He indicated he was healing the last time I talked with him, only to hear from him again and confirm he’s now at peace. May his soul rest in peace. Be cautious out there and watch what you get engaged with. Be prayerful as well. Everything is fine.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Oscar-Brown-3.jpg alt="Oscar Brown" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Fan Reactions</h2><p>In response to the tragic news, his followers went to social media to pay respect.
