However, their marital problems became a significant part of her story on RHOA. The couple have been the subject of several infidelity rumors, which began for the first time when Ralph disappeared for several days on a trip to Tampa during the couple’s first season on the show.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Throughout Season 15, Drew and Ralph’s problems continued as they tried to find ways to keep their marriage on track. In the season finale, Drew revealed that she and Ralph were no longer sleeping in the same bed due to her hectic schedule filming her co-star <a href=#>Kandi Burruss and Todd Tucker</a>’s movie, The Pass. However, the couple seemed to be in good spirits before the show wrapped filming for the season at The Pass’s premiere party.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After the show wrapped production in January 2023, the closing credits showed that the team returned to filming after Ralph and Drew’s divorce filing became public on March 1, 2023.

Ralph claimed that it was Drew who had “inappropriate relationships” and not him, as she previously suggested. When a producer asked about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ty Young</a>, Ralph cryptically said that she and Drew have a “friendship” that he didn’t feel ready to discuss at the moment.</p><p>Drew also didn’t have much to say about Ty, except to deny that they were a couple. She confirmed she met the former WNBA player on the set of The Pass, as Ty is close friends with the co-star who played Drew’s love interest. She also said she felt her now estranged husband, Ralph, was the one who “leaked” the rumor that she and Ty were an item and said he “conjured up” several lies to make Drew look bad.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Although Drew denies dating Ty, her co-stars and Ty’s ex, <a href=#>Love & Hip-Hop alum Mimi Faust</a> have different sides to the story.

Courtney, however, went so far as to say she had pictures “in my phone” of Drew and Ty together. She also hinted that Drew and Ty’s relationship was why Drew wanted Ralph to adopt her oldest son, Josiah.</p><p>“Now we see why she was pushing so hard for that adoption,” Courtney said in a confessional. “Because she was like, ‘Adopt this child so I can go be in my gay lover relationship and you pay the bills.'”</p><p>According to Ty’s former LHHATL co-star, <a href=#>Rasheeda Frost</a>, Ty and Drew are still going strong.

Although she didn’t name him directly, Drew said a certain “King of the NBA” bought her a drink when she was in LA. Drew said she and the mystery man went out a few times and supported each other’s goals.</p><p>“We went out on a couple of dates, he flew me out to his games, he listened to my music before his games … all the games he was winning were off of my music ... I'm just saying.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>LeBron’s name was bleeped out of the episode, but clues from the episode made fans suspect that he was the person Drew was talking about. However, Drew stated they dated before LeBron married his high school sweetheart, Savannah, in 2013.
