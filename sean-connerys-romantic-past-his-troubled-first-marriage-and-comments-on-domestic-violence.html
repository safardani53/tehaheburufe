"I don't think there is anything particularly wrong about hitting a woman, although I don't recommend doing it in the same way that you'd hit a man," he told the publication.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Describing an "openhanded slap" as "justified," Connery also said it could be used "if all other alternatives fail and there has been plenty of warning," adding, "If a woman is a bitch, or hysterical, or bloody-minded continually, then I'd do it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Years later, during a sit-down with Barbara Walters in 1987, he elaborated on his quotes to Playboy. "I haven't changed my opinion... If you have tried everything else – and women are pretty good at this – they can't leave it alone. They want to have the last word and you give them the last word, but they're not happy with the last word. They want to say it again, and get into a really provocative situation, then I think it's absolutely right," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Six years after his Barbara Walters interview, the actor spoke with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> about his views. "But I was really saying that to slap a woman was not the crudest thing you can do to her. I said that in my book—it's much more cruel to psychologically damage somebody... to put them in such distress that they really come to hate themselves," he said. "Sometimes there are women who take it to the wire. That's what they're looking for, the ultimate confrontation—they want a smack."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, in 2006, he appeared to claim his previous remarks were taken out of context. "My view is I don't believe that any level of abuse against women is ever justified under any circumstances. Full stop," he told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Times of London</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same year, his first wife Diane Cilento, who he was married to from 1962 to 1973, released her autobiography My Nine Lives, in which she alleged that Connery had abused her mentally and physically during their relationship. He previously denied the allegations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There was physical contact, but it is important to see it in context. You have got to remember he was probably twice my weight," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Scotsman</a> in 2006.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Hulton Archive/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor wed his second wife, French-Moroccan artist Micheline Roquebrune in 1975. Cilento, who shared son Jason with Connery, died in October 2011.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Saturday, Connery died overnight in his sleep while staying in the Bahamas. He was 90. A cause of death was not given.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"His wife Micheline and his two sons, Jason and Stephane have confirmed that he died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by family," a rep for the actor told PEOPLE. "There will be a private ceremony followed by a memorial yet to be planned once the virus has ended."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0miqnpmeYrCwus2eqbKrXae8rq3NraCcZaCWwLV5x6KqZqyipMKjuMSdZJ%2BhoqjBbrnAq6mimZeaeqK6w2aaqKWdmru1v4yopWacn6KytMDInGSvoZ%2Bhsq%2BvxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nnx6a2sagn4rjcfmo4rfegnfrklipe5b.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carrie-coon-19810124-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carrie Coon (TV Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
