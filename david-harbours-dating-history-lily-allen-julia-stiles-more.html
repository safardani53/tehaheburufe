I’m better at the fantasy of relationships than I am at the daily real life, but I”m trying to steer myself into a realist,” the <a href=#>Stranger Things </a>actor told <a href=#>Women’s Health</a> in October 2017, two years after he split from ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Julia Stiles</strong></a>.</p><p>He added, “What I find most exciting now is sharp, intelligent, insightful women. People who are deep thinking, who have sort of a weird way of looking at the universe are wildly attractive to me. So if I can find one of those gals who can stand me, then maybe I might have something thing.”</p><p>Harbour found “one of those gals” about two years later when he met the “Smile” singer on a dating app.</p><p>“I was in London alone, doing Black Widow, on this app, going on dates and stuff,” he shared with<a href=#> GQ UK</a> in July 2022. “I started texting with her, she was in Italy at the time — we got together, went on a date at the Wolseley and it was, you know, she’s f–king unbelievable.”</p><p>The Dartmouth College alum had <a href=#>put on weight</a> to play the <a href=#>Red Guardian</a> in the Marvel movie, so he wasn’t feeling his most confident about his physical appearance.</p><p>“She claims to have fallen in love at first sight with me — I mean, who wouldn’t?” Harbour quipped. “I remember the exact moment. It was our third date. I was just in this phase, where I was like, I’m just going to be brutally honest about everything, because why lie? And I told her something about my life, about my beliefs … It would take a really extraordinary person to be accepting of the things that I said. And I remember thinking: Wow, that’s somebody I want to be around.”</p><p>He decided to make things official<a href=#> after one year of dating</a> after an exchange with Allen’s kids. The England native shares <a href=#>daughters Ethel and Marnie</a> with <a href=#>ex-husband <strong>Sam Cooper</strong></a>, from whom she split in 2016.</p><p>“We were riding around at the beginning of the [coronavirus] pandemic — she has two kids, these beautiful daughters, 8 and 9 — and we were riding bikes out in the country trying to figure out what we were gonna do for the next year or however long it was going to take,” Harbour recalled during a June 2021 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. “And the little one was riding along and she was going like, ‘David, Dad, David, Dad.’ Because the ‘d’ got her confused. And the older one got very upset with that, which I understand, and she was like, ‘He’s not our dad! He’s not our dad!’”</p><p>He continued: “And the younger one was like, ‘Well, what is he? He’s kind of our dad.’ She’s like, ‘No, he’s not.’ ‘He’s kind of our stepdad.’ ‘No, he’s not.’ And she goes, ‘What is he?’ And she goes, ‘He’s just some guy in our lives!’ … I was like, ‘I need to marry this woman.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Harbour married Allen in an Elvis-officiated ceremony in Las Vegas in September 2020.</p><p>Scroll down to see the women Harbour has linked to throughout his career:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksaLCyJ1koZmil7y2vtJmm5qsmaO0brTIrKuoqqliuaq42GaYpaSVo3qrwcuimGarpJ65pr%2BMpqarnV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./don-benjamin-wife-liane-pregnant-baby.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Don Benjamin And Wife Liane V Announce Theyre Pregnant</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andrew-ng.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Andrew Ng</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
