Which lead us to the question: <a href=#>Is Borat actually staged</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Amazon</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are 'Borat' and the 'Subsequent Moviefilm' staged?</h2><p>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm sees its titular character, Borat, travel around the U.S. as he attempts to present his daughter Tutar as a gift to the president of the United States. But since Borat got himself in a little trouble with Donald Trump during the first movie (he was filmed trying to take a poo in front of Trump Tower), his plan shifts to presenting his daughter to one of Trump’s close aides, like Mike Pence (or Rudy Giuliani).&nbsp;</p><p>When the first Borat film was released back in 2006, the studio production notes from 20th Century Fox said that “there was no script” for the film. However, a quick look at the movie’s credits revealed that the “unscripted” movie had no fewer than four listed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenwriters</a>, including the film’s star, Sacha Baron Cohen.</p><p>After the movie’s release, during a question and answer session at the Writers Guild of America, Sacha revealed that 80 percent of the movie had scenes that the writers “set out to accomplish.”&nbsp;</p><p>Sacha explained that the writers created the script by imagining the many ways each scene could play out and asking the question, “What do we want it to look like?”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Amazon</span></figure><p>“The principle that we use is we go in as scripted as possible,” Sacha <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> of the writing process. “But then you’ve also got to be prepared to throw everything away if new opportunities present themselves.” The written script also helps the filmed material come together in post-production in terms of a plot and how the story melds together with Borat’s antics in the world.</p><p>What ended up on film for the first movie, Sacha said, was remarkably close to the 60-page script they came up with. And to ensure the studio wouldn’t know what they were up to either, they submitted a five-page outline to 20th Century Fox, which claimed that the movie was “an experiment — a new form of filmmaking for an age in which reality and entertainment have become increasingly intertwined.”</p><p>To be fair, the experiment worked. Sacha and his fellow-screenwriters were even nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, so it’s only natural that the team decided to rely on their tried-and-true formula for the movie’s second installment.&nbsp;</p><p>Like it’s predecessor, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is semi-scripted, and the sequel will focus around Borat and his daughter’s journey through America as the team behind the scenes orchestrates a number of scenarios in the "real world."</p><p>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm premieres on Oct. 23 on Amazon Prime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurs6rmK1lo6muqLHD</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./five-scents-keep-foxes-out-of-garden.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Im a pest control expert five scents that will keep foxes out of your garden</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./coolio-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of Rapper Over The Years Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
