His parents never married.</p><p>Jonas grew up with his mother, Danute, so he inherited her surname. However, his Father, Jonas Vilkas, had a close relationship with him from childhood. Vilkas formerly worked as a rowing master in the USSR.&nbsp;</p><p>He attended Utenos Gymnasium in his hometown, Utena, and began playing basketball early. Meanwhile, his mother wanted him to be a folk dancer and had enrolled him in a dancing class.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jonas-with-his-mother-Danute.jpg><p>Valanciunas often bunked his dance classes and went out with his friends to play in his childhood.</p><p>At that time, basketball was very popular in Lithuania, and there was a massive attraction of youth towards the sport.</p><p>He was no different. Even though his mother did not want him to choose the sport, his Father helped him to be a better basketball player while growing up. He prepared a training ground and homemade basket for Jonas to practice.</p><p>While still in high school, Jonas was admitted to a local training school in Vilnius. He was already taller than his friends and did well in the academy.</p><p>Jonas soon attracted national team management’s attention with his performance. As a result, the player secured his place on the Lithuanian U-16 team. He represented his country in the 2007 European U-16 Championship held in Greece.</p><p>However, he could only make a big impression by participating in the same tournament the following year held in Italy. In 2008, he had already given up folk dancing and primarily focused on basketball games.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;Jaxson Hayes: NBA, Domestic Violence & Net Worth >>></strong></a></p><p>Moreover, his mother started supporting him and promised to provide him with everything he wanted as he was her only child.</p><h2>Jonas Valanciunas | Career</h2><h3>Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL)</h3><p>Jonas started his professional league journey in 2008 at age 16. He played in the LNKL for the Perlas Vilnius. After playing the 2008-9 season in the country’s second-best league, the club stepped up to the LKL.</p><p>Subsequently, he signed a long-term contract with the Lietuvos Rytas in January 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>He finally moved to the Rytas on January 17, 2010, and started playing in top-tier leagues. In February, they won the 2010 LKF Cup. Valanciunas soon won the team’s trust and played many matches.</p><p>In his two-year’s career, he won numerous trophies and cups for the club. He played all three LKL Finals between 2010 and 2012 and had great stats. They even became the LKL champions in 2010.</p><p>Moreover, he appeared in three LKL All-Star Games and won all three times. He became the LKL All-Star Game MVP consecutively in 2011 and 2012.</p><p>He earned so much international fame that people started talking about him across the Atlantic in America. As a result, the young Lithuanian emerged as one of the best prospects for the 2011 NBA draft.</p><p>He was close to his dream of playing in the NBA, the world’s biggest basketball league.</p><h3>NBA Career</h3><h4>Toronto Raptors</h4><p>After training briefly at the pre-draft NBA camp in Italy, Jonas came to America for the 2011 draft. Toronto Raptors selected him as the draft’s first-round 5th pick.</p><p>The rookie finished the season with an average of 8.9 points and 6.0 rebounds per game.</p><p>Moving onto the 2013-14 season, he played more matches and improved his stats. He averaged 11.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game in 81 contests. In addition, he kept a record by recording the most rebounds in a single playoff game against the Nets.</p><p>Jonas extended four more years in the club, signing a contract with the Raptors on August 20, 2015. ESPN named him the 57th best player of the league before the start of the new season.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he played fewer matches than in the previous NBA seasons this year due to injury.</p><p>He played 60 matches with an average of 12.8 points and 9.1 rebounds per game. Returning to the court after a long rest, he led the Raptors to the playoffs this season.</p><p>However, they did not make it to the NBA Finals after they suffered his loss due to an ankle injury during Game 3 against the Miami Heat.</p><p>Valanciunas played three more seasons for the Raptors. Eventually, the club traded him to the Grizzlies in 2019.&nbsp;</p><h4>Memphis Grizzlies</h4><p>Jonas Valanciunas was traded to Memphis Grizzlies along with a few other players on February 7, 2019. He made his debut for the club on February 12 against the San Antonio Spurs.</p><p>He scored a fantastic 23 points and 10 rebounds in his debut, but the club lost the match. However, after suffering from another injury in a game against the Clippers, he missed the remainder of the 2018-19 season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jonas-in-the-Memphis-Grizzlies-jersey.jpg><p>The club signed a new three-year contract with him on July 11, 2019.
