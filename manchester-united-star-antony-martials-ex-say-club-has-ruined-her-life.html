Footballers in England are like kings. They have so much money and attention it’s like they live in a different world.</p><p>“He was thrust into the limelight and it all just exploded. Young girls were throwing themselves at him.”</p><p><a href=#>The Sun on Sunday revealed Martial, 20, cheated with an X Factor wannabe who he flew to Paris</a>.</p><p>Samantha, 23, said: “He had never looked at another girl before we moved and I’d never once doubted him, so the fact he’d cheated shook me to the core.”</p><p>He also moaned she was boring.</p><p>She added: “Anthony told me I was a grandma — that I didn’t like going out and he didn’t love me anymore.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256446773.jpg><p>Since the split Samantha says Martial has seen Peyton just four times, including taking her and his parents on holiday to Guadeloupe.</p><p>She blamed his transformation on last year’s switch from French side Monaco.</p><p>She said: “I was told United was a family club but off the pitch he didn’t get any guidance. Manchester United have ruined my life.</p><p>“Neither of us were prepared for it at all. Everywhere we went people would stop Anthony for pictures and his Instagram followers rocketed to more than two million.</p><p>“Other big clubs like to offer support to players in managing their social media but we were offered nothing.</p><p>“He was getting a dozen pictures a day on Instagram from girls. They sent sexy photos begging him to get in touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000207760473.jpg><p>“These girls don’t care about a player’s family or the woman he’s with, they want the designer handbags, shoes and media attention that seeing a footballer brings.”</p><p>Yet despite the image, Samantha branded £5million-a-year Martial “stingy”.</p><p>She said: “When we split I tried to work things out. He said I only wanted him for his money.</p><p>“But he was so stingy. Anthony told me he rent a house for me. I found one outside Paris, but when I got the keys he said he was only going to give me £3,000 a month. He earns £420,000 every month.</p><p>“Anthony has changed completely from the modest, shy and loving young man I met in Monaco and I firmly believe if we’d stayed there then we would still be together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256421276.jpg><p>“We lived a nice life with privacy. We both liked being at home and not going out to flash bars and restaurants. Anthony never even drank alcohol.”</p><p>Samantha met Martial when he was just 17. After a year together she fell pregnant.</p><p>Daughter Peyton was born two months early in June last year.</p><p>She weighed just 3lb 5oz and spent her first few days in an incubator.</p><p>Samantha said: “Finding out I was pregnant was a good surprise. Anthony was 18 and I was 21 but we couldn’t wait to be parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000257668311-e1471118609413.jpg><p>“When Peyton was born it was touch and go. I had an emergency caesarean and was in a wheelchair for days. But Anthony was so strong for both of us.</p><p>“He changed Peyton’s nappies, cradled her and helped to feed her as well as helping me to shower and dress.</p><p>“He was amazing and it made our relationship stronger.”</p><p>They set up home in a rented four-bedroom Cheshire mansion with a pool and gym. But Samantha struggled to make friends.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>She said: “The club organised events for us to meet other players and their families, but I didn’t speak much English and the girls my age didn’t have children.</p><p>“My focus was Peyton, so I wasn’t interested in going to bars or restaurants all the time.</p><p>“I went home to France to see my family at least once a month and they came to see me too.</p><p>“I went shopping to the Trafford Centre occasionally, but I barely left the house.”</p><p>In January Martial told Samantha he was going to Paris to visit his parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256446731-e1471118352702.jpg><p>But The Sun on Sunday revealed he had spent a night in a luxury hotel with X Factor wannabe Emily Wademan, 25, after chatting on Twitter.</p><p>Just days earlier Samantha had become suspicious when she spotted a fan’s online photo with Martial in the French capital.</p><p>She said: “I saw this guy posing with Anthony and so I said something like, ‘Oh that’s a nice picture of my boyfriend’. He said, ‘Thanks. It was really nice to meet you.’</p><p>“I hadn’t been with Martial that day — but the fan thought he had met me. I could only assume he was with another woman.</p><p>“Then when the story came out and I knew I had been right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256446749-e1471118380614.jpg><p>“I asked Anthony about it but he said I was a “crazy bitch” and denied he had done anything to betray me.”</p><p>Samantha flew to France with Peyton and spent a week with her family.</p><p>She said: “When I came back to Manchester I told him I wanted to make it work for the sake of our daughter.</p><p>“Anthony swore to me that he hadn’t touched Emily and he joked the only person he’d ever look at apart from me was Selena Gomez.”</p><p>Samantha, who hired a nanny so she could go to the gym three times a week, said then-manager Louis Van Gaal was the only United employee who tried to make Martial do the right thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000256446727-e1471118401420.jpg><p>She said: “Anthony said when he had turned to Van Gaal for advice after the story came out he said, ‘You came with her, you stay with her.’ Anthony didn’t get in trouble for bringing the club into disrepute. He was just told to sort it out.</p><p>“It is so different in the Premier League. In France players are expected to behave in a certain way but we were offered nothing. When Anthony found himself in trouble he didn’t get any help.”</p><p>Samantha started finding mystery phone numbers in his phone. He became hooked on watching French TV show Les Anges, <a href=#>starring Melanie Da Cruz</a>.</p><p>When Martial went away with the French national side in March Samantha saw he had been trying to Facetime Melanie. He said she was just an old friend.</p><p>Then, just days before he returned, Samantha discovered he had blocked her phone number.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000249848172.jpg><p>She said: “One day he was messaging that he was missing us both, and the next he had blocked my number.</p><p>“I couldn’t work out what was going on. But When he came home he was really cold and said I had been getting on his nerves and he didn’t want to be with me anymore.</p><p>“It was a massive shock. It was April 1 and at first I thought it was an April Fool joke. I called Melanie.</p><p>“She said it wasn’t just sex between them and that she only got into serious relationships.</p><p>“I begged her to leave him alone, but she wasn’t interested.”</p><p>Martial and Melanie have not been pictured together, but they have both posted snaps from the Greek island of Santorini.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000258814533-e1471120179536.jpg><p>Martial had refused to take Samantha there saying it was too expensive.</p><p>Samantha said: “Now we barely communicate. He arranges to see Peyton by messaging my mum.</p><p>“I think any young man thrown into this world of celebrity and money would probably react in the same way. But Anthony had responsibilities. He had a partner and a child.</p><p>“I do worry that when she grows up Peyton will prefer spending time with her dad — with his enormous house and money to take her anywhere in the world and do whatever she wants.</p><p>“But my close friends and family reassure me that children want love and security, not material things.</p><p>“For now I want to draw a line under what happened and move on.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH53fJVrbW5nnZa7pLTErKueql2qu6rAxJ1krKyRp3qiutOopbJlnZa%2FtbXApapmnahiwKLFjJyjrppdna60edGuoKedlGK1pr6MpaCfnV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-pedersen-19890401-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Pedersen (Entrepreneur) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lea-simanjuntaks-boyfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lea Simanjuntaks Boyfriend: Who is Lea Simanjuntak Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
