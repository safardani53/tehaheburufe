It's a bad juju type of thing.’ But she wouldn't do it," says Hutton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A longtime Buddhist, McKay wrote Lewis letters in prison and supported his early, paroled release.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We were contacted every time he came up for parole,” says Hutton. “None of us would OK it except for her.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Police had heard about a theft at McKay's house before her murder, says Crittenden County Chief Investigator Todd Grooms. After she died, Hutton read in her diary that she'd sold a chandelier for $10,000 cash, which she stashed in the house.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis happened to be there that day, says Hutton. “Then the money vanished. She fired him after the money disappeared,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family is still reeling from the fact that the same man killed her sister, mother, and cousin – 23 years apart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We are all just in disbelief,” says Hutton.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Ontq6xjpqppGWnpLqiuoybnJ%2BqmZq7pbHDZqSopaNiuKq4y56pZqelqXqwsoysp6KqmanCoriMqJmloZeWwaq7zWaYp5xdqbWmuoyhnGalpaexpr7EnWShnaJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./catherine-mooty-age-and-wikipedia-how-old-is-troy-aikman-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Catherine Mooty Age And Wikipedia: How Old Is Troy Aikman Wife?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-things-i-hate-about-you-cast-where-are-they-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'10 Things I Hate About You' Cast: Where Are They Now?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
