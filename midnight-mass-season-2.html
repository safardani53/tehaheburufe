But will Mike Flanagan's 'Midnight Mass' have a Season 2?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Anyone who uses <a href=#>Netflix</a> knows that the platform has been creating more and more original content over the years, and the horror series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Midnight Mass</a> is only the latest in a slew of horror series from writer-director Mike Flanagan. Mike's previous works include fan-favorite horror shows such as The Haunting of Hill House and <a href=#>The Haunting of Bly Manor</a>, based on famous horror novels by Shirley Jackson and Henry James, respectively.</p><p>Midnight Mass is an entirely original concept by Mike for Netflix, and already audiences have been dying for more. Will there be a Midnight Mass Season 2? And where was the show filmed? Here's everything we know about Midnight Mass.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many episodes of 'Midnight Mass' are there, and will there be a Season 2?</h2><p>In July 2019, Netflix announced that they were commissioning a seven-episode horror series with Mike Flanagan to serve as the writer, director, and executive producer. Based on the success of his previous horror shows, many thought that Midnight Mass would be another series based on classic horror novels but were surprised to learn that this creation would be entirely original.</p><p>In true Mike Flanagan fashion, many of the actors who appear in Midnight Mass have previously appeared in his other series. Returning actors include Kate Siegel, Rahul Kohli, Henry Thomas, Alex Essoe, Robert Longstreet, James Flanagan, Annabeth Gish, and more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Fans have wondered if there will be a Season 2 of Midnight Mass based on the show's critical success. Currently, Midnight Mass is listed on Wikipedia as a "miniseries," which could indicate no further seasons. Mike Flanagan is already working on his next horror series for Netflix titled The Midnight Club, based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Pike. The show will reportedly incorporate elements from other Christopher Pike novels as well.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'Midnight Mass' filmed?</h2><p>Midnight Mass is set in a small, isolated community on the fictional Crockett Island, but where was the show filmed? Mike Flanagan wasn't shy about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posting to social media</a> about the shooting of the show, and filming took place at Garry Point Park in Richmond, Canada, with prep starting in December 2019.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Elvira Lount (@elvira)</a></p></figure><p>Sadly, due to the coronavirus pandemic, Mike and his wife Kate Siegel along with the rest of the cast and crew were forced to leave the set when filming halted. "Kate and I were the last Americans from the show to leave Vancouver, and from the airplane window, I could see our sets standing at Garry Point Park. They'd remain standing for months, at the mercy of the elements, and we had no idea when or if we'd be able to return."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>With COVID protocols in place, filming prep was able to resume in July 2020, and filming officially began in August 2020, according to Mike's Twitter thread. Filming wrapped in December 2020, and Mike expressed his gratitude on the social media platform for the safety of his cast and crew.</p><p>Midnight Mass is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforalusign61lnZbAtHnSnpisp55ifw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
