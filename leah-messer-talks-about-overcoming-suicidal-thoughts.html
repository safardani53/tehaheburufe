They are my life. … I wasn’t in the greatest place mentally and then it was affecting me physically, like it almost cost me my children. I became suicidal. It was a struggle.”</p><p>Once she discovered “this life is worth living,” Messer, 26, said she used motivational words to put herself in a better headspace: “It’s like I had to train my mind to know that I am love, I am confident, I am worthy and … I said that repeatedly to myself and like, it just did wonders.”</p><p>The MTV star also encouraged her kids — 8-year-old twins Ali and Aleeah, whom she shares with 29-year-old Simms, and 5-year-old daughter Addie, whom she shares with <a href=#><strong>Jeremy Calvert</strong></a> — to do the same. “Even for my girls, when they started school this year, they knew,” she noted. “Addie wrote on the chalkboard, she was like … ‘I am happy because I have a family that loves me,’ and she even put like why and blessed.”</p><p>Messer hopes her fans can relate to and learn from the issues she has weathered. “There’s a lot that I will address on the podcast. My role … is to share what I have went through and what I’ve learned as I’ve went through it,” she told Us in October. “Every high and low in my life … that’s what I’m most excited to share and truly help others with things that may be going through the same things.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Messer told listeners on Thursday: “Today I would say that I am kind, I am loving, I am confident, I am courageous, I am strong.”</p><p>If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the <a href=#>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZGdeq6x0qycq2Wklrmsv4yamaitpGK8t7HRnKamoZ6cerTByJygnZmcYsGpu9Sgn62rXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mads-lewis-reveals-plastic-surgery-on-tiktok-live.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mads Lewis Opens Up About Her Plastic Surgery On TikTok Live</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ayla-woodruff.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ayla Woodruff</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
