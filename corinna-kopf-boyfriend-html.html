She has also been streaming on Facebook Gaming since December 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The&nbsp;Palatine native&nbsp;initially rose to prominence with her appearances on <a href=# rel=follow>David </a>Dobrik’s&nbsp;vlogs. She has been&nbsp;a regular fixture in Dobrik’s Vlog Squad group&nbsp;since 2015, where her&nbsp;persona in Vlog Squad videos often centered on adult jokes about her relationships with the men in the group. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Speaking of relationships, Kopf has dated lots of men in the past. That said, many fans are curious to know who is Corinna Kopf dating at present. The answer to that was recently publicized by the diva herself, as she took to her Twitter on September 22 to imply that she was single on that date. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“i want a boyfriend,” she wrote in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">straightforward tweet</a>, stating she was back on the market for a new boyfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Fans’ Varied Reactions</h2><p>Immediately after&nbsp;Kopf announced that she was looking for a new boyfriend, fans on Twitter went&nbsp;fizzy and put their case forward.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>“I’ll take you to Olive Garden every Sunday,” one wrote. Another chimed, “Hey im right here.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There were also some users who were informing their friends that&nbsp;Kopf was single and asked them to be her date. Doing that, someone wrote, “Bal4nce_ she wants you.” Similarly, another added, “@ewekasidney&nbsp;Time to shine.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Despite all the proposals and catchy pickup lines,&nbsp;Kopf didn’t respond to anyone. Maybe, she is still filtering through the comments while hoping to find the perfect one.</p><p>Her&nbsp;September 22 tweet was a follow-up to the previous tweets she tweeted in the same month. In one of the tweets&nbsp;she shared she dreamt of making out with <a href=# rel=follow>Lil Nas X</a>, while in another one, she said she wanted to become a baby mama. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here are those tweets:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>i had a dream last night that i made out with lil nas x — pouty girl (@CorinnaKopf) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">September 21, 2021</a></p><h2>Corinna Kopf's Dating History</h2><p>One of the popular names whom&nbsp;Kopf dated was <a href=# rel=follow>Logan Paul</a>, a fellow&nbsp;YouTuber, and social media personality, around 2019. The couple was also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seen together</a> that year&nbsp;at a basketball game wearing matching yellow sweatshirts.</p><p>During an episode of&nbsp;Impaulsive podcast in July 2021,&nbsp;the diva shared that she never saw her togetherness with Paul as a relationship. Instead, she revealed he was one of her many “hook-up” friends from the&nbsp;fraternity. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“It took us a year to have [romantic relationship] because he [Paul] refused to get an STD test,” she added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>During the same podcast,&nbsp;Kopf also confirmed dating Twitch streamer&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Adin Ross</a> in the past while adding it was the relationship she regretted the most.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She explained her statement by saying that she received hate messages and comments from Ross’ fans, who claimed she used him for followers. In her defense, Kopf said she was not running after followers but dated him because she wanted to and ended it later when she felt the relationship was not right for her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In addition,&nbsp;Kopf has also briefly dated streamer&nbsp;Turner Tenney, musical artist&nbsp;Toddy Smith, and&nbsp;vlogger <a href=# rel=follow>Brennen Taylor</a> at different times.</p><p>Well, looking at her history so far, it is apparent that she has majorly been in&nbsp;friends with benefits kind of relationships. Respecting her choices, we just hope she also finds someone who would keep her permanently.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJufp7avusBmoqiolmKvsMXFq6CeppRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./agate-caune.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Agate Caune net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lizzy-musi-and-kye-kelley-enjoy-honeymoon-after-street-outlaws-drama.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lizzy Musi and Kye Kelley enjoy honeymoon after Street Outlaws drama Wed 21 December 2022 15:16</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
