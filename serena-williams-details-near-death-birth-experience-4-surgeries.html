Every time I coughed, sharp pains shot through my wound. I couldn’t breathe. I was coughing because I just couldn’t get enough air. I grabbed a towel, rolled it up, and put it over my incision. Sure enough, I was hacking so hard that my stitches burst.”</p><p>The My Life: Queen of the Court author went into surgery to get restitched, but the procedure was “the first of many surgeries.” In fact, Williams called the experience “a fog of surgeries, one after another,” noting that her husband, <a href=#><strong>Alexis Ohanian</strong></a>, eventually “gave up on trying to leave” the hospital to shower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Serena-Williams-Describes-Near-Death-Birth-Experience-and-4-Surgeries-2.jpg><p>“I was coughing because I had an embolism, a clot in one of my arteries,” she wrote. “The doctors would also discover a hematoma, a collection of blood outside the blood vessels, in my abdomen, then even more clots that had to be kept from traveling to my lungs.”</p><p>The Olympian, who was unable to leave the hospital for a week, went on to describe her “body’s wreckage” postpartum, writing, “My entire being was just so tired at that point. When I first got home, I couldn’t walk down the driveway. When I finally made it to a tree halfway down the driveway, it was a big hurdle for me.”</p><p><a href=#>Williams previously spoke to Vogue</a> about the scary experience in January 2018, joking that she told hospital staff to “listen to Dr. Williams!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The tennis star was, in fact, the one to draw attention to her blood clots. On Tuesday, she recalled, “I spoke to the nurse. I told her: ‘I need to have a CAT scan of my lungs bilaterally, and then I need to be on my heparin drip.’ She said, ‘I think all this medicine is making you talk crazy.’ I said, ‘No, I’m telling you what I need: I need the scan immediately.’”</p><p>Connecting with Olympia during her recovery was “both reward and validation,” Williams concluded. “I still feel like I have to be around her for every day of her life, as much as possible,” she gushed. “I’m anxious when I’m not around her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasnaKau6J51qKjpaGRosBusMStmKKko2K7pq3RZpuemaSdeqO10a2fZp2opbKztcSnmp5lZGLAtr7GnqminaNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-9-episode-6-recap-tastes-l.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 9 Episode 6 Recap: Tastes Like Trouble</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kourtney-kardashian-to-kim-happy-birthday-you-non-witch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kourtney Kardashian to Kim: Happy Birthday, You Non-Witch!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
