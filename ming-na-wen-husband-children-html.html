So, Wen called up her acting teacher, who in turn gave Zee her number and asked him to drop her off.&nbsp;</p><p>Wen also confessed that she was not into Asian men at the time and so she sent him off to see the premiere while she went out to have dinner with her girlfriends.&nbsp;</p><p>She recalled that all of her girlfriends' first reaction to seeing Zee was, "Who's that guy? He's cute." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Much like Wen, Zee is also a resident star in Tinseltown with acting credits in movies like&nbsp;Independence Day&nbsp;(1996),&nbsp;Fist of Legend&nbsp;(1994), and&nbsp;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&nbsp;(1993).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>The World's Greatest Dad</h2><p>The last time fans saw Zee on Wen's Instagram was on June 20, 2021, i.e., on Father's day.&nbsp;</p><p>The post featured a series of snaps from the couple's various family vacations around the world. Of course, their two children, daughter Michaela&nbsp;and son Cooper Dominic, also accompanied them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the caption, the actress called her husband the greatest dad in the world and their favorite travel agent&nbsp;because&nbsp;Zee had facilitated all their family vacations around the globe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She further elaborated that it was because of Zee that the family got to experience the beauty of other cultures, languages, and cuisines. She&nbsp;thanked him for creating so many pleasant memories for the family to look back on.&nbsp;</p><p>"WE LOVE YOU FROM HERE TO THE ENDS OF THE UNIVERSE!," she wrote before wishing a happy Father's Day to all the other dads out there.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Wen's Daughter Is 20</h2><p>Wen also celebrated her daughter's 20th birthday with a special post on her Twitter handle.
