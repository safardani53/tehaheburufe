The quarterback for the Buffalo Bills – who has been integral in helping resurrect the franchise and make them a contender in the NFL’s American Football Conference (AFC) – has been making news on and off the field over the past year. The pro athlete, 27, has been dating <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hailee Steinfeld</strong></a> since earlier this year. Josh and Hailee got together after he split from his long-term girlfriend, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brittany Williams</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Josh and Hailee’s new romance came amid speculation that Josh and Brittany split. She unfollowed Josh on Instagram and wiped all photos of him from her account. Unlike <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Swift’s</strong></a> very <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>public romance</a>, Josh and Hailee have been a bit more low-key with their relationship.&nbsp;For those unfamiliar with Josh, here’s a quick look at Hailee’s man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Josh-Allen-The-Buffalo-Bills-QB-ss-embed-1.jpg><h2><strong>Josh Allen Is an NFL Quarterback</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Josh, who was born in 1996, is a quarterback who joined the NFL in 2018. He grew up near Firebaugh, California. After playing for a season at Reedley College, he transferred to the University of Wyoming. He played two games in his first year at Wyoming before suffering a broken collarbone. He returned in 2016 to play two full seasons, throwing for over 5,000 yards.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The Buffalo Bills drafted Josh as the seventh overall draft pick. <strong>Baker Mayfield</strong> was that year’s No. 1 overall pick. Josh started his rookie season as a backup quarterback to <strong>Nathan Petermen</strong>. He soon took over for Nathan and got his footing in the following seasons. In 2020, he led the Bills to their first division title and their first playoff victory since 1995. In 2022, the 13-3 bills stood atop the AFC East. They were ultimately eliminated in the playoffs by the Cincinnati Bengals, but with Josh at the snap, the team remains a potential threat. So far in the 2023-24 season, the Buffalo Bills are 3-1.</p><h2>Josh Is Dating Hailee Steinfeld</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Josh and the Oscar nominee were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first linked in May 2023</a> when they were spotted out in New York City. Josh and Hailee <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>showed off major PDA</a> during a Fourth of July weekend trip to Mexico. After being seen out and about together, fans quickly began talking about the new relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“The fact that anybody cares about that still blows my mind,” Josh said during an August 2023 episode of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pardon My Take&nbsp;podcast</a>. He revealed that he spotted photographers taking photos of him and Hailee in Mexico. “I just, like, felt this gross feeling,” Josh said. “Insecurity. No privacy. [I was] like, ‘What is wrong with people?'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>They’ve been keeping a low profile ever since. However, Hailee stepped out with Josh’s mom, Lavonne, in October 2023. They were seen shopping at the Leveled Up Buffalo Shop in East Aurora, New York. The shop’s owner, <strong>Lindsey Vega</strong>, posted a photo of Hailee and Lavonne together on the shop’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram page.</a></p><h2><strong>Josh Likes to Golf</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Josh Allen is an avid golfer, and he gave all his offensive linemen new clubs at Christmas in 2022. When asked who he would love to golf with, he named the GOAT. “I got to throw <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tiger</strong> [<strong>Woods</strong>]</a> in there,” Josh told the Buffalo Low Down. “I am a big Tiger Woods fan. He is probably one of the most influential athletes in my life. It was him and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kobe Bryant</strong></a> who were the two athletes that my heartbeat when they were in a pressure spot. I felt the pressure with them.” Filling out his golf foursome would be <strong>Kevin Kearns</strong>, director of communications for the Buffalo Bills, as well as Josh’s dad.</p><h2><strong>Josh Was Injured in 2023</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>In 2018, Josh became <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the first quarterback to rush</a> for at least 95 yards in three consecutive games. Heading into the 2023-24 season, he had over 3,000 rushing yards, with 38 rushing touchdowns. However, leaving the pocket puts Josh at risk – and he has paid for it. He led the league in turnovers (with 19) and suffered a UCL sprain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Josh-Allen-The-Buffalo-Bills-QB-ss-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I can’t continue to do this,” Josh said about his playing style, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sports Illustrated</a>. “I know when I’m using my youth, I feel like I can. But over the course of my career, I’m gonna have to learn to adapt and change. … When that point [comes], I don’t know. I guess I’ll let my body tell me. “But I do want to be, like I said, I wanna be the smartest quarterback with the football in my hands. I don’t wanna put the ball in harm’s way.”</p><h2><strong>Josh Dated His Childhood Friend</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>In 2017, Josh began to date Brittany.&nbsp;The two of them grew up in Firebaugh, California, and they were in college when they started dating. At the time, she was a Fresno State cheerleader. She graduated in the spring of 2018 with an Agribusiness/Agricultural Business Operations degree. As of 2022, she ran her own online-based Pilates program called Pilates by Britt, which is Mat and Reformer Pilates. She and Josh got a dog together in 2021. They named the pooch Sky and introduced the dog to all their followers in June of that year. Josh and Brittany split in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3sL%2FHZpilpJWjenZ9j3Fwb3Ff</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./abigail-thaw.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Abigail Thaw Actress Biography, Marriage, Husband, Age, Wiki, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./merry-kiss-cam-jesse-bradford-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Merry Kiss Cams Jesse Bradford On His New Holiday Movie: Exclusive Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
