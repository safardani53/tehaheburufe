He is deadly serious. “This isn’t a funny record. It’s not a joke.”</p><p>Calling the band Fat Cops arguably doesn’t help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000472455769.jpg><p>But being in a band is every middle-aged bloke’s fantasy and<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Murray</a> — best known for his Pub Landlord alter ego — has always wanted to make music.</p><p>He has played the drums since he was nine and was in several prog-rock bands as a teen.</p><p>He says: “I wanted to be a drummer when I was a lad but I realised I wasn’t good enough.</p><p>“My stand-up took over and drumming was parked for a while. The big difference is that at the end of a stand-up gig, I don’t have to pack up a drum kit and lug it out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000472455736.jpg><p>Fat Cops describe their music “hip-shakin’, garage-groovin’, punk-glam chaos”. Which seems fair enough.<br>In short, their self-titled debut is exactly the sort of album you would expect a gaggle of middle-aged blokes to come up with.</p><p>Their influences seem clear enough — Ultravox on the track Fat City, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Happy Mondays</a> on Hands Up! Get Down! — making this probably the perfect album for centrist dads who spent the Nineties grooving and shaking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stone Roses</a> and Primal Scream.</p><p>The members of Fat Cops certainly were.</p><p>The lyrics on the ten tracks deal with typical issues for men of their age — and ageing in particular.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000251612424.jpg><p>Murray says: “The songs are about masculinity in the modern age, especially for older guys who should know who they are but find the world changing around them.</p><p>“It’s not just a record for middle-aged men, though. It’s for anyone with disposable income.”</p><p>I caught Fat Cops at the Kendal Calling festival in Cumbria last July.</p><p>All eyes were on their luxury double-decker tour bus with blacked-out windows as it rolled into the festival grounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000472605524.jpg><p>Fans chattered excitedly and took pictures, wondering which megastar was on board. Perhaps it was one of the festival headliners — <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Run DMC</a>, perhaps, or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Libertines</a>.</p><p>The curious mob were left a bit underwhelmed when the bus rumbled to a halt, the doors opened and six middle-aged, slightly overweight blokes stepped out.</p><p>These unlikely hitmakers met at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Edinburgh Fringe Festival,</a> where comics and journalists mix with locals in lively boozers.</p><p>Joining Murray in the line-up are journalists Chris Deerin and Euan McColm, doctor Neil Murray (husband of none other than <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">JK Rowling</a>), IT manager Chris Ayre — and former Bluebells frontman Bobby Bluebell, who wrote the hit song Young At Heart and penned tunes for Scots chart-toppers Texas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000472455768.jpg><p>Chris Deerin says: “It is one of the stranger bands around because of the people in it. We all have different day jobs and none of us are in our twenties.” Murray adds: “The name Fat Cops fits. If you look at us, we look like a bunch of out-of-shape narcs, a bit like the cast of New Tricks.”</p><p>They decided to hire Guns N’ Roses’ old tour bus for their first gig...knowing it might turn out to be their only live show.</p><p>But when they hit the stage that evening, they wowed their audience. To call them a novelty act would do them a gross disservice.</p><p>They were good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000472455766.jpg><p>Murray says: “It’s nice that people don’t seem to be going ‘Where are the gags?’ or ‘Stick to the day job’.</p><p>“That feels like a result. We’re not a bunch of blokes in their forties or fifties who’ve learned All Right Now and Money For Nothing.”</p><p>The album was crafted over ten days in a recording studio, while the band were trapped inside by the “Beast from the East” — the polar vortex that plunged Britain into deep freeze for several weeks last year.</p><p>Will the album go down as an instant classic?</p><p>Or will it remain a mildly interesting curio, merely a reminder of the time when the comedian Al Murray started a band?</p><p>Most likely it will end up somewhere in between.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in showbiz</h2></p><p>Fat Cops won’t conquer the world but neither is it a toe-curling mid-life crisis of a record.</p><p>The band clearly relished this late chance to hit the studio, lay down some tracks and take to the stage, bringing to reality dreams that had lain dormant since their teenage years.</p><p>Some of that enthusiasm makes it on to the record — and the sheer joy of it all is infectious.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Fat Cops</h3></p><p>1.
