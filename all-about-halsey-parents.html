Chris and Nicole dropped out of college after becoming pregnant with Halsey in 1994. They later welcomed two more children, Halsey's younger brothers SÃ©vian and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dante</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Grammy-nominated artist has described her childhood as being turbulent but full of love. At 19, Halsey was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>kicked out of the house</a> after dropping out of community college and later reconnected with them after signing a record deal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Families go through cycles, and my father and I have a really great relationship now," Halsey said in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Zane Lowe</a> in January 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halsey has taken Chris and Nicole to various red carpet events and given them shout-outs on social media over the years. In 2020, Halsey shared photos and a video of Nicole on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> with the caption, "happy Mother's Day to my best friend. ðŸŒ¼."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same year, the singer posted an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> tribute to Chris for Father's Day, writing, "I love you and I'm grateful for everything you have blessed me with. ðŸ’—."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here is everything to know about Halsey's parents, Chris and Nicole Frangipane.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chris-and-nicole-became-parents-at-a-young-age></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Chris and Nicole became parents at a young age</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>A photo collage of Halsey from their childhood, featuring parents Chris and Nicole Frangipane.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Halsey Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chris and Nicole were in college when they found out they were pregnant with Halsey. In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> in June 2019, the singer revealed that she lived in their parents' dorm for the first few years before the pair dropped out of school and started working to support their family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chris was a car dealership manager while Nicole worked as a hospital security guard â€” and they sometimes worked two jobs each. As a result, the family relocated frequently. "My parents moved where the jobs were," Halsey told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marie Claire</a> in July 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halsey spoke to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a> in January 2019 about attending a new school almost every year until age 13.

"I look like a white girl, but I donâ€™t feel like one. Iâ€™m a black woman. So itâ€™s been weird navigating that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halsey spoke to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vulture</a> in June of that same year about microaggressions they experienced as a family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I was little, if someone saw me and my dad walking through, like, a grocery store parking lot, women would come up to us and be like, 'Sweetie, are you okay?' " the singer recalled. "Because they saw a little White girl walking with a Black man."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2021, Halsey told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Byrdie</a> that privilege was an "understood, unspoken thing" in their family. While Nicole helped her family secure a home by speaking to landlords because "everyone was more likely to help out what looks like a young single white mom," Chris was questioned while "picking me up from preschool, or taking me to the doctor or to get my hair done."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's with this little white baby.

"There was always s--- being thrown."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At 17, Halsey was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>diagnosed with bipolar disorder</a>, a condition her mother has as well. The singer told Marie Claire that, as a result, their childhood was somewhat unpredictable. They recalled: "We'd be like, 'What's for dinner?' And [my mom would] be like, 'Ice cream and roller-skating.' And we'd go to the roller rink and eat ice cream for dinner."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halsey later told Rolling Stone in 2019, "I had to learn to cook for myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, in May 2015, she shared with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elle</a> seeing her mom be herself without reservations "made me more open to being myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If I had parents who were normal, and crazy things started happening to me ...

After graduating from Warren Hills Regional High School in Washington, New Jersey, she was accepted to the Rhode Island School of Design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, when Halsey discovered she couldn't afford the tuition, she withdrew her admission and took classes at a community college instead before dropping out. As a result, Halsey's parents kicked them out of the house, and the singer moved to the Big Apple with their then-boyfriend, where they began refining their music skills.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They just didn't agree with a lot of things about me," Halsey told Rolling Stone in 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2017 interview with Vulture, Halsey explained that she hadn't spoken to their parents in over a year when she called to tell them she had landed a record deal, and Chris immediately flew to Los Angeles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halsey, Chris and Nicole have fostered a strong relationship despite the rocky patch. In September 2020, the singer gave their dad a shout-out for his birthday on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>. "I love you and you're the most charming, intelligent, kind dude I know," Halsey wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Mother's Day 2021, Halsey shared a photo of her mom on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> and captioned it, "They always tell us, 'Oh no!

I changed my mind and wanted a viola â€” they got me the viola," the singer added. "Every holiday, I got an art kit. I'd wreck the carpets and walls. They'd lose their security deposit. All because I wanted to paint my bedroom."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halsey recalled that Chris thought her ambitions weren't practical, but Nicole persuaded him to come around. In an interview with Glamour in 2019, Halsey remembered hearing Nicole tell Chris, "'We can't hold her back. We don't know what she can become.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer also shared that their father had an excellent memory while working as a salesman and would always remember small details about people he hadn't seen in years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Watching my dad be like that affected me as an artist tremendously," Halsey said.
