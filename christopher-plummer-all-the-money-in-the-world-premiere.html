He’s one of them. He pulled it off brilliantly, with great support from Dan Friedkin, and Bradley Thomas, and the people at Sony. We all loved working with Ridley so much that we had all the faith in the world.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Broadimage/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plummer looked happy as can be at the premiere.

He gave his outfit a pop of color with a red pocket square.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also giving the press line a pop of color was Williams, 37. She wore a fitted scarlet halter gown with a satin bodice, accented with ruffle details and a dangling neck scarf.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wahlberg, 46, stayed classic a three-piece blue suit with a crisp white shirt and bright blue tie.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amanda Edwards/WireImage</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All the Money in the World tells the story of the infamous kidnapping of Getty’s grandson and the billionaire’s reluctance to pay the ransom. Williams plays the missing boy’s mother Gail Getty, who frantically tries to convince her wealthy father-in-law to pay her son’s ransom as the kidnappers become increasingly more violent. Wahlberg stars as an advisor to the billionaire who becomes an unlikely ally for the desperate mother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The film is based on the book by John Pearson and written for the screen by David Scarpa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scott, along with production company Imperative Entertainment and TriStar, made the decision to replace Scott with Plummer. Though costly (the reshoot reportedly ran nearly $10 million, a quarter of the film’s original reported $40 million budget), Scott told Entertainment Weekly it was an easy decision to make.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You can’t tolerate any kind of behavior like that,” Scott said. “It will affect the film. We cannot let one person’s action affect the good work of all these other people. It’s that simple.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Kevin Spacey Accused Of Sexual Misconduct By Eight House Of Cards Employees: Report</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He had the support of his costars, including Williams who had been an outspoken critic of Spacey’s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m so very proud to be a part of this — we’re all here for Ridley,” Williams told EW, later recalling being stunned when she learned of the allegations against Spacey. “When this idea was hatched, I immediately started to feel better. This doesn’t do anything to ease the suffering of people who were all too personally affected by Kevin Spacey, but it is our little act of trying to right a wrong. And it sends a message to predators — you can’t get away with this anymore. Something <i>will</i> be done.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kevin Spacey and Christopher Plummer.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>AP/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plummer said he was in early talks to play Getty before the House of Cards actor was cast, so there was little hesitation to take on the role.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It isn’t replacing. In a funny way it’s starting all over again because it’s going to be different, naturally,” Plummer told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Entertainment Tonight</a> at the premiere of The Man Who Invented Christmas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think it’s very sad what happened to him. Kevin is such a talented and a terrifically gifted actor, and it’s so sad. It’s such a shame,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Plummer added, when speaking to Vanity Fair at the screening</a>. “That’s all I can say, because that’s it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spacey is currently checked into a specialist treatment facility following the numerous allegations that have been made against him. The actor’s team has not responded to any of the accusations ever since he expressed regret for allegedly making inappropriate sexual advances toward actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Anthony Rapp</a>, then 14 years old, in 1986. Spacey issued a statement saying he doesn’t remember the alleged incident, apologizing for “for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior” and announcing, “I choose now to live as a gay man.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All the Money in the World hits theaters Friday.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>With reporting by SCOTT HUVER</strong></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0miaoaqZqMGwvMeeqWaonKq6rrHRZpilpF2ptaZ5zKilnrFdnrtuwMeeZLCnoqGxbrzRnqSinaKafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./desperate-housewives-cast-where-are-they-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Desperate Housewives Cast: Where Are They Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gabriel-iglesiass-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gabriel Iglesias Dating Gabriel Iglesias's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
