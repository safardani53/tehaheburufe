"Since I had little else to do and badly needed distraction, I began to notice and record things," Dan recalled. &nbsp;</p><p>He was particularly interested in the way nurses would handle his bandages. "Every day, I had to have a soaking bath that involved removing my bandages and scraping off my dead skin and flesh," Dan wrote. "The nurses would rip off the dressings all at once, without a break. It was excruciating, but the nurses insisted that tearing the bandages off was the best way."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Many years later, Dan conducted research around this theory and found the opposite to be true: People are more willing to endure a lower level of pain for a longer period of time than a higher level of pain over a shorter period of time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Dan concluded, "If my nurses, despite all their experience with burn victims, had erred in treating the patients they cared so much about, other professionals might also be misunderstanding the consequences of their behaviors and make poor decisions." The celebrated researcher continues to explore that theme in many of his studies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6vecCroJ6kqWKvpq3RnWSam5Oesaa60w%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heidi-klum-nude-photo-throwback.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heidi Klum Nude Photo Throwback</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christian-siriano.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christian Siriano</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
