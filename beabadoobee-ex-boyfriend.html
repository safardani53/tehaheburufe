Born Beatrice Kristi Laus, Bea first rose to fame on the platform for her song “Coffee,” also known as "death bed (coffee for your head)" which dominated the platform in 2020. She also went viral for her <a href=#>“I really want Miso soup” audio</a>, fully cementing her as a TikTok icon. <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> even tapped the Filipina-English talent to join her on <a href=#>Eras tour</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition to sharing updates about her music and life as a cat mom, Bea loves to share TikToks about her life featuring her loved ones. Her longtime followers have watched Bea as she has fallen in love, but also as she faced heartbreak and betrayal.</p><p>Since early 2023, Bea has been in a relationship with a London-based director <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob Erland</a>. But before she met Jacob, she was in a serious relationship with another director for seven years. Their breakup was beyond messy and to further rub salt into the would, her ex-boyfriend then started dating Bea's friend. The drama has been never ending. So, who is Bea's ex-boyfriend? And who is his new girlfriend? Keep scrolling to find out.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Bea's ex-boyfriend? She and Soren Harrison dated for seven years. Then Soren started dating her friend.</h2><p>Bea’s ex-boyfriend is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soren Harrison</a>. They were believed to have started dating when she was 15 years old and broke up in June 2022 after seven years together. Fans were devastated by the news, with many believing that they were the perfect couple.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Soren was the inspiration behind a number of Bea's songs, most notably 2019 track "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soren</a>." It's unclear why Bea and Soren broke up. Some fans have speculated that Bea and Soren were in an open relationship, while others claimed that was untrue, arguing they split because someone cheated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Following their breakup, Soren got into a new relationship with stylist, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Molly Hayward</a>, who is the owner of the highly popular vintage clothing brand on Depop, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Not Just Trash,</a> which features an assortment of handmade and up-cycled pieces. While no one wants to see their ex move on, that's not why Bea's fans were upset. Bea and Molly were friends and Molly betrayed her.</p><p>Bea was a big fan of Molly's work and had hired her to style her on a number of occasions, including for her music videos “Worth It" and "Together." In 2021, Molly told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britsh Vogue</a> that Bea wasn't just her client, but also her close friend.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>That said, when news broke that Molly and Soren were dating, Bea's fans were heartbroken for her. And they were riled up even more when Molly began acting petty on social media. After Bea released her touching ballad "The Way Things Go" in 2023, which was her breakup with Soren, Molly shared an Instagram story posing with Soren that included the song's lyric "I guess that's just the way things go."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Molly also posted a video of Soren to this song, which further enraged Bea's fans. One Bea supporter even claimed in a TikTok that if they were in the musician's shoes, they would "genuinely start World War III."</p><p>Bea has yet to publicly discuss Molly's online jabs at her. Molly's personal social media accounts appear to be private and/or were deleted. It seems Molly and Soren arenow trying to keep their relationship on the downlow to avoid backlash from Bea's fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KirsCdpqialZp6psSMm6aynqKesq%2Bw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lisa-mcclowry.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Lisa McClowry net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-paul-haggis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Paul Haggis and what is his net worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
