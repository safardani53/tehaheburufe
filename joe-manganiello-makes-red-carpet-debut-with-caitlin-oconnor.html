The <i>Magic Mike</i> star wore a black suit with a charcoal button-down shirt, and the UCLA graduate shined in a forest green satin slit gown with diamond-encrusted stiletto heels. Joe attended the upscale event to accept the COAF Humanitarian Award.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Two months prior, the pair were first spotted on several outings together in California, sparking relationship rumors. That month, <i>PEOPLE</i> confirmed that they were “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>casually seeing each other</a>.” A source told the outlet that they had met at an “unofficial” afterparty for her HBO series, <i>Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.</i> The insider added that they “met in the hot tub” at the soiree and “were talking the whole time.” Later that month, the publication reported that Joe and Caitlin were officially dating.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In July, Joe filed for divorce from Sofía, 51, after being married for almost 10 years. He cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason why they split and noted that their date of separation was July 2. Earlier that month, the former couple announced their divorce in a statement to <i>Page Six.</i> <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/joe-manganiello-sofia-vergara-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“We have made the difficult decision to divorce,” Joe and Sofía explained in their statement. “As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect of our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Joe and Caitlin have been enjoying their time together, Sofía has been dating <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Justin Saliman</b></a>. According to multiple outlets, the duo was first spotted together in October. Justin is an orthopedic surgeon based in Beverly Hills, who works at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in L.A.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Before the<i> Modern Family</i> alum and Justin began their romance, Sofía’s single status became a big topic on <i>America’s Got Talent </i>over the summer. Her fellow judge Howie Mandel was seen teasing her about dating. Despite walking off stage on one occasion in response to one of Howie’s jokes, Sofía appeared to be a good sport about the situation. She also reflected on her and Joe’s divorce during an interview with PEOPLE in November.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I’ve had a very interesting year,” she pointed out. “I don’t want to say ‘bad’ or anything like that, but it’s been very interesting and very difficult. I went through a divorce this year, the SAG strike that went on for so long. I’ve seen my friends struggle — some had to take their kids out of their schools or had problems with their mortgages, so it’s been a weird, weird year.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>However, Sofía insisted that she didn’t see it as a “bad” year, noting,&nbsp;“I think all the things are resolving, everything is going to be OK, and I’m very excited for next year.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BqZqOnlWK6orrGmqWinZyhvG65wKScrGWimrFur8Crp56sXZmyo8HTZq6irJhisKK106Wgp2WfmLyvus6rZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dwyane-wade-gabrielle-union-marriage-wedding-details-groomzilla-chateau-artisan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Their $5 Million Wedding Details Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-does-jenna-bush-hager-live.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jenna Bush Hager's New House Is Seriously Gorgeous</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
