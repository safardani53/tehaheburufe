At a time when inflation is at a high, it makes sense to protect your investment and keep your clothing in mint condition.</p><p>That said, the general upkeep of clothes includes regular washing and dry cleaning, depending on the item. The drying machine is known to cause random pairs of socks to disappear and can sometimes result in shrunk clothes.</p><p>So, if you’re fond of <a href=#>pulling pranks</a>, one <a href=#>TikTok</a> user has gone viral for tricking their partner into thinking they shrunk their clothes with Barbie clothing. Here’s the full scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@morgandmillerr</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A TikTok user tricked her boyfriend by using Barbie clothes for a shrunken laundry prank.</h2><p>Guard your clothes, folks! In a May 30, 2023, TikTok creator Morgan Miller (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@morgandmillerr</a>) shared how she pranked her significant other by using Barbie clothes for a shrunk laundry prank.</p><p>As the video starts, Morgan gives viewers the lowdown on her plot to prank her boyfriend.</p><p>“He’s about to be home from work. And when he gets home, I’m going to ask him to switch the clothes from the washer to the dryer and then when he leaves, I’m going to replace them with all of these Barbie clothes and convince him that he shrunk all of our laundry,” Morgan said while showing the toy clothes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@morgandmillerr href=#>@morgandmillerr</a><p>“Thats my JaCKeT” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i am still laughing at this so hard omg.

The boyfriend proceeds to take the clothes out of the washing machine and loads them into the dryer.</p><p>In the next clip, Morgan then says, “It’s go time,” as she switches the clothes in the dryer with the Barbie clothing. She then positioned her camera and set the timer for one minute so the buzzer will go off causing her boyfriend to check the clothes.</p><p>Like clockwork, the boyfriend comes out of a room and checks the dryer. He opens the door, closes it, and opens it again. He then shouts for Morgan to let her know that the clothes have “shrunk.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@morgandmillerr</a></figure><p>“What is this?” the boyfriend asked her. I just opened it. Look at it. I literally just opened it.</p><p>“What did you do?” Morgan says while chuckling. “My skirt. OMG. Babe, your work pants.”</p><p>“My work pants?” the boyfriend asked with his hands on his head.</p><p>Morgan then asked him if he knows how to dry clothes and he insists that he does and followed instructions. Morgan explained that the drying machine is an old model and that he had to “turn off shrink mode.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@morgandmillerr</a></figure><p>Her boyfriend questions her about having it on shrink mode and she continues to act shocked about the clothes. As Morgan continued to laugh about the clothes, her boyfriend insists that it was not funny since some of his clothes shrunk.</p><p>As her boyfriend was cooking, Morgan teased him about ironing his work pants and showed him the black Barbie doll pants as the video concluded.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok users love the Barbie clothes prank and teased Morgan’s boyfriend about his reaction.</h2><p>Everyone loves a good wholesome prank. And in this case, folks think that Morgan executed the prank perfectly.</p><p>“Is there a large mode? 🤣 This poor man will never recover from this,” one user commented.</p><p>“When he opened the dryer, closed it, and then opened it again 😭😭😭😭😭. I completely lost it,” another person shared.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@morgandmillerr</a></figure><p>“The way he thought closing the door was going to reset reality 😂😂😂😭😭🤣,” one user chimed in.</p><p>It’s safe to say Morgan’s boyfriend will never look at clothing dryers the same. Good job Morgan!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66zrsieZJykn6m1pr%2BMrJ%2BrrZ6geq2t1Kebq7Fdpb%2Biuso%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carmina-villaroels-husband-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carmina Villaroels Husband: Who is Carmina Villaroel Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dominic-fike-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Euphoria' Star Dating Hunter Schafer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
