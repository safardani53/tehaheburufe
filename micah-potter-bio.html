He is one of the four children of his father, Tim Potter, and mother, Ronda Potter.</p><p>The NBA player’s parents have been together for more than two decades; they married on August 11, 1991.</p><p>He has an older brother named Caleb and two younger siblings: brother Noah & a sister named Emma. All of his siblings engaged in athletics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Micah-Father.jpg><p>Not to mention, the Potter’s grandfather Bob Potter played at Kent State in the 50s and also taught Tim and his siblings the mechanics of shooting a basketball.</p><p>Bob used to tie his son’s (Micha’s father Tim) left hand behind their back before guiding them outside to work on their shots.</p><p>The technique years later came in handy to Tim, helping his son Micah with the one-handed shots. Micah also grew to love the process of shooting hundreds of one-handed shots each day.</p><h2>Details On Micah’s Siblings!</h2><h3>Oldest Brother Caleb</h3><p>Micha Potter’s eldest brother Caleb played outfielder for college baseball team at the West Virginia University (2015-16) and then at Southern New Hampshire University (2016-17).</p><p>A graduate with Sports Management from New Hampshire, Caleb Potter currently works as an account manager at Part Place Technologies (November 2021- now).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Caleb-Potter-And-His-Wife-Abby.jpg><p>Previously, he worked as a project supervisor at NVR, Inc. (2018-20) & then as a consultant at Konica Minolta Business Solutions (2020-21).</p><p>Moreover, Caleb is married to Abby C. Potter; they exchanged vows in mid-2021.</p><h3>Younger Siblings</h3><p>The NBA power forward’s brother Noah is a college football player who played for Ohio State Buckeyes (2019-21). He was a four-star prospect from Mentor High School.</p><p>After nearly losing his right eye during his junior year (that required him surgery), Noah Potter remained off the field.</p><p>On May 16, 2022, he entered the transfer portal & later enrolled at North Carolina State University on December 22.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Micah-Potter-With-His-Siblings.jpg><p>Micha’s younger sister Emma Potter is no behind her siblings in athletics. She is currently a four-year letter winner at Mentor High School & competes in track & field.</p><p>Emma was born on November 8, 2002.</p><h2>Education & College Career</h2><p>Micah Potter attended Mentor High School in his hometown of Mentor, Ohio. After playing three years with Mentor, Micah transferred to Montverde Academy in Montverde, Florida, for his senior season.</p><p>After successful high school basketball, Micah committed to playing collegiate basketball for Ohio State.</p><p>He began his freshman season for the Ohio State Buckeyes in the starting lineup, but because of the ankle injury, he missed two games and was replaced by Trevor Thompson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Micah-Ohio-State.jpg><p>Similarly, his sophomore year did not go well either. His ankle sprain in the fourth game took away his playing time, and he only received a few minutes on the court.</p><p>Just two days before his junior season, Micah announced his intention to transfer to the University of Wisconsin-Madison from Ohio.</p><p>He completed his junior and senior seasons with the Wisconsin Badgers, which has been home to NBA players: <a href=#>Sam Dekker</a> & <a href=#>Frank Kaminsky</a>; and to NFL players: <a href=#>Russell Wilson</a> & <a href=#>J.J. Watt</a>, to name a few.</p><h2>NBA Career</h2><p>Despite having the best of the collegiate career, Micah went undrafted in the 2021 NBA Draft.</p><p>Other notable players undrafted in that year included Jose Alvarado, Joël Ayayi, Chaundee Brown & <a href=#>Austin Reaves</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, his NBA dream came true when Miami Heat signed him for the 2021 NBA Summer League.</p><p>On September 10, 2021 Micah signed a rookie contract with the team. He later joined the Sioux Falls Skyforce as an affiliate player.</p><p>Similarly, he signed a 10-day contract with the Pistons on December 29, 2021, but later rejoined Sioux Falls Skyforce.</p><p>For the 2022 NBA Summer League, he joined the New York Knicks.</p><p>Nevertheless, on October 12, 2022, Micah signed a two-way deal with the Jazz and has been with the team ever since.</p><h3>Injury</h3><p>The Jazz rookie has been ruled out for at least four-to-six weeks on January 27, 2023, because of right elbow surgery.</p><p>He was examined by the Jazz medical staff and underwent MRI testing on Jan 21. The report from the examination revealed loose fragments in his right elbow.</p><p>Micah will be re-evaluated in four to six weeks.</p><h2>Net Worth & Contracts</h2><h3>Net Worth</h3><p>Micah Potter, as of December 2023, has an estimated net worth between $50k to $200k.</p><p>Even though several online sources have claimed it to be more than that, the rookie has yet to score a jackpot contract-wise.</p><p>So the net worth range seems justifiable.</p><p>Besides, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Spotrac</a>, he has earned just about $53k from the NBA so far and considering his G-League earnings and sponsorships, his fortune seems just about okay.</p><h3>Contract</h3><p>On September 10, 2021, Micah signed a one-year $925k contract with the Heat using Exhibit 10, which is a one-year, minimum-salary deal that allows the team to convert the contract to a two-way contract.</p><p>Similarly, he signed a ten days $53k contract with the Pistons on December 29, 2021.</p><p>After the conclusion of this deal, the Pistons signed Micah on a contract using Exhibit 10. This contract was worth $1,637,966.</p><h2>Personal Life & Wife</h2><p>The Jazz rookie Micah is a man of faith and describes himself as a devout follower of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>This makes sense, given that his father, Tim, is a pastor, as is his grandfather, Bob.</p><p>Tim did try to become a basketball player, but nine leg surgeries took his dream away.</p><p>Talking about his relationships, Micah is a married man. He married Elle Van Grinsven, a former volleyball player and a graduate of Loyola University Chicago, on June 11, 2021, in Lomira, Wisconsin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Micah-Proposing-To-His-Girlfrined.jpg><p>They got engaged on July 1, 2020, in Park City, Utah, and broke the news to their admirers via social media with the caption, “WE’RE ENGAGED!
