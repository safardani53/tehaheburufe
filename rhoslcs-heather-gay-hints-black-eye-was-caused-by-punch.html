What does it look like?” Heather responds. “I’m just going to shut down and I don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p>In her own interview, Lisa is in disbelief when the Bad Mormon author says “we don’t know” what happened after previously admitting that she just didn’t want to talk about it.</p><p>“Wait, did you get some short-term memory loss with that black eye?” Lisa asks. “Like, you just said two different things in two seconds.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/%E2%80%98Real-Housewives-of-Salt-Lake-City-Sneak-Peek-Heather-Gay-Implies-Black-Eye-Was-Caused-by-Being-Glocked-in-the-Face-2.jpg><p>After Heather says she doesn’t think the black eye is “that noticeable,” the Vida Tequila founder replies, “Heather, are you insane? You look like somebody, like, clocked you.”</p><p>“Well, maybe somebody did [and] they don’t want to talk about it,” Heather says. “I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to make the trip about my black eye, honestly.”</p><p><a href=#>Us previously asked</a> Heather about the injury, which was first revealed in the trailer for the season.</p><p>“When I saw the jiggle of that door handle, I didn’t know that there were hidden cameras in my room. So when I saw the season — the trailer for the second half of the season — and I saw, like, me in a towel approaching the door and them jiggling the handle — I didn’t know [I] was being recorded, and had no idea,” she explained earlier this month. “So I am now waiting with the rest of America to see [it].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When asked about all the theories surrounding the situation, she added: “Well, I mean, listen, it’s not the first time I’ve had a black eye. It’s probably not gonna be the last time I’ve had a black eye. You know, you wake up with a black eye, you move on, you make the best of it. You try not to let it affect your life too much.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp6OhsLR5x56YraCVp3qordhmn6KmpKh6o7jAnKJmnamaerit0maamq2jmrFurthmp66mk518</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shun-loves-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shun Loves Boyfriend: Who is Shun Love Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-knox-photos-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of The Author Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
