It is all dependent on one’s passion and communication skills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/maria-1164.jpg><p>Moving on, Maria is a rather tall lady standing at the height of <strong>6’2″ (1.88 m)</strong>, easily towering over her colleagues.</p><p>No wonder she was in college volleyball and basketball, totally attributed to her incredible stature.</p><p>Similarly, the sports analyst weighs a proper<strong> 60 kg (132 lb)</strong>.</p><h2>Maria Taylor | Career: Sports Analyst</h2><p>Before she landed a big gig, Maria worked as a reporter for<strong> IMG College</strong> while still in her college years.</p><p>In the meantime, the soon-to-be sportscaster made several guest spots on <strong>SEC Men’s Basketball Tonight, Sports Nite</strong>, and <strong>Dawg Report</strong>.</p><p>Likewise, Taylor covered Saturday-night primetime college football telecast for ESPN2 as well as the <strong>Orange Bow</strong>l, reporting the same two years in a row.</p><p>Besides, the Alpharetta native was an analyst for <strong>NCAA Women’s Basketball Shows and Tournaments.</strong></p><p>Subsequently, after handling everything dealt to her, Maria rose in popularity, and many broadcasting companies were eyeing to sign her.</p><p>Further, <strong>SEC Network</strong> earned her services in 2014 and appointed her as a college football reporter.</p><p>Alongside <strong>Brent Musburger</strong> and <strong>Jesse Palmer,</strong> Taylor fulfilled her hosting duties with utmost elegance.</p><p>After which, she had an opportunity to fill in as an analyst in other segments, most notably women’s volleyball and basketball.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/maria-1165.jpg><p>On the contrary, in 2014, the Georgia-based sportscaster agreed to join as a reporter and host for ESPN’s College Gameday segment, filling instead of <strong><a href=#>Samantha Ponder</a></strong>.</p><p>At the same time, Taylor covered the playoffs between Georgia and Oklahoma Universities.</p><p>In 2018, the network also assigned her the hosting duties for <strong>College Football Playoff National Championship</strong> between Alabama and Georgia Universities.</p><p>Apart from these, Taylor enjoys time at ABC network as a sideline reporter covering the <strong>Saturday Night football</strong> matches and the assistance of <a href=#><strong>Chris Fowler</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Kirk Herbstreit</a>.</strong></p><h2>Why is Maria Taylor a Professional?</h2><p>Being a sportscaster is not an easy job, and seriously, Maria Taylor makes it seem quite easy. When I say that, it’s crystal clear through the 2018<a href=# rel=noopener> Nick Saban</a>, Maria Taylor interview.&nbsp;</p><p>To illustrate, while Maria covered Alabama’s 51-14 win over Louisville, she had taken an interview with coach Nick Saban.</p><p>As the interview progressed, Maria questioned Saban about his quarterbacks, Jalen Hurts and <a href=# rel=noopener>Tua Tagovailoa</a>.</p><p>However, Saban had a heated response that dropped awkwardness on television.</p><p>Even though Taylor showed her elegance and moved to the other questions swiftly and happily, that moment, a few minutes of talk sprouted, bought disgust for <a href=#>Nick Saban</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, the news outbroke and gave criticism to Nick.&nbsp;</p><p>Altogether, <a href=#>Nick Saban</a> did apologize for his behavior towards Taylor. Apparently, when Taylor was on “<strong>The Paul Finebaum Show</strong>,” she also stated she was fine with it.</p><p>“I’ve been yelled at by coaches since I was 12 years old playing AAU basketball. Do you know what I mean? I’ve been called everything under the sun, and by any coach, you can imagine. So it didn’t really affect me in that way. I understand that coaches get heated at times, and there are things they don’t really want to talk about. As a sideline reporter, you’re in the line of fire, and I just got lit up once. And that’s fine. And I received a call from Saban even before I got to the highway leaving the stadium. That’s how passionate he was about getting the apology out. And I’m so thankful, and I respect him for making that call.”<br>-Maria Taylor</p><h2>Maria Taylor Net Worth | Salary & Income</h2><p>In particular, Maria has been working as a reporter for over a decade and, in this period and surprisingly, amassed a stunning <strong>$2 million</strong> net worth.</p><p>During her career, the African-American sportscaster worked for ESPN, so she likely earned a significant sum.</p><p>Accordingly, sources reported that Taylor pockets about <strong>$87,885</strong> as an annual average salary.</p><p>Further, upon contract renewal, there was a considerable upgrade to her wages, so assumably her net worth will be on the rise in a few years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/maria-1166.jpg><p>Additionally, As a result of her coverage of women’s sports and various other channels, her income could increase.</p><p>Likewise, a deal with<strong> ESPN </strong>reportedly sees Maria walk away with a whopping <strong>$100k</strong> per year for serving as a sideline reporter.</p><p>Most importantly, the Georgian is living an exquisite lifestyle, which is given because of her mouth-watering income.</p><p>Nonetheless, Maria is as giving as anyone can be. In other words, the sportscaster indulges in several humanitarian works from time to time.</p><p>For instance, The Winning Edge Leadership Academy is one of the social service organizations Taylor actively endorses.</p><p>The organization aims to uplift women by inculcating leadership qualities, specifically those belonging to the minority.</p><h2>Maria Taylor Relationship Status | Husband & Wedding</h2><p>Indeed, an <strong>African-American sportscaster</strong> is a married woman. The man who managed to steal the beautiful Journalist’s heart is none other than <strong>Rodney Blackstock.</strong></p><p>In the same way, the two first met while enjoying the game against Charlotte Hornets back in 2014. Also, Rodney made an effort to have a conversation.</p><p>Simultaneously, the two exchanged numbers and texted each other often. None were aware that love was blooming between them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/maria-1168.jpg><p>At one point, Taylor remarked that she felt weak in the knees when she first laid eyes on him and had a “that’s the one” feeling.</p><p>Thereafter, Rodney and Maria started dating, and eight months later, the former popped the question. It came as a no-brainer to the sportscaster.</p><p>They were to be wedded couples in June 2016, although both agreed that things were moving too soon, and wedding bells had to wait for some time to ring.</p><p>During a hike somewhere in L.A., Rodney planned a special proposal with a flower-embellished halo ring. This time she said yes and was ready to take a step towards a happily married life.</p><p>Eventually, on May 5, 2019, the couple was bound in holy matrimony in a romantic venue at the Hilton Sandestin located in Destin, Florida, that overlooked the ocean.</p><p>Likewise, Maria donned a lovely gown by Eve of Milady for an all-white-themed wedding.</p><h2>Some FAQs:</h2><h3><span>Did Maria Taylor leave ESPN?</span></h3><p>As our sources say, after working there for some time, yes, Maria Taylor left ESPN after failing to reach a contract extension.&nbsp;</p><h3><span>Where is Maria Taylor working now?</span></h3><p>According to the current information we have, Maria Taylor is currently working for NBC Sports.</p><h3><span>What’s between Maria Taylor and comedian Rickey Smiley?</span></h3><p>Maria Taylor and comedian Rickey Smiley are good friends, and back about their 2015 stuff, Maria was seen promoting his show, “Rickey Smiley For Real.” In the meantime, they were also rumored to be dating.
