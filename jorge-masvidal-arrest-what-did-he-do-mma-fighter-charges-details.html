Masvidal was born in Miami and raised there by his Peruvian mother and Cuban father. Masvidal claims that when he was a boy, his father fled Cuba and arrived in the Virgin Islands on a handmade raft.</p><p>Masvidal’s father was deported after serving more than two decades in prison for manslaughter and drug trafficking. Masvidal became engaged in street fights at an early age. You may see footage of him defeating Kimbo Slice’s disciple “Ray” on YouTube. Masvidal wrestled at St. Brendan High School, but his academic performance disqualified him from continuing. He subsequently started karate and mixed martial arts training. Jorge competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) welterweight category.&nbsp;Jorge has also appeared in World Victory Road, Shark Fights, Bellator, and Strikeforce events. Masvidal has been a professional since 2003. Jorge, who holds the record for the fastest knockout in UFC history with a five-second knockout, was awarded the inaugural UFC “BMF” Championship belt.&nbsp;Jorge is currently rated 11th in the UFC welterweight ratings for 2022. Masvidal made his MMA debut on May 24, 2003, with a knockout victory at HOOKnSHOOT: Absolute Fighting Championships 3.</p><h2>Is Jorge Masvidal in jail?</h2><p>According to reports, Masvidal, who had recently lost to Colby Covington at UFC 272, was accused of attacking Covington on March 22, 2022.&nbsp;Masvidal reportedly came up on Covington as he was exiting a restaurant and attacked him twice, breaking one of his teeth and injuring his wrist. Masvidal was detained and charged the next day with criminal mischief and aggravated violence resulting in grave bodily injury.</p><p>Masvidal was jailed at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Facility, released on a $15,000 bail, and then arrested again.&nbsp;Masvidal’s arraignment date was set on April 21, 2022. He did, however, finally plead not guilty to the accusations.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Jorge-Masvidal-1.jpg alt="Jorge Masvidal" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Details About Jorge Masvidal’s Arrest and Charges</h2><p>MMA fighter Jorge Masvidal is being held in detention in a Miami jail, according to ESPN’s Marc Raimondi, after being charged with aggravated violence with bodily harm and criminal mischief. The bond for Jorge Masvidal has been set at $15,000.&nbsp;Masvidal and Colby Covington got into a violent altercation that required police intervention. Covington beat the other in their UFC 272 battle on March 5.</p><p>On April 21, 2022, the state attorney’s office requested and got a continuance, which is now valid until April 28.&nbsp;On April 28, Masvidal was granted a stay-away order, and the charges for aggravated violence were modified in response to accusations that Covington sustained brain damage as a result of the alleged incident. A pre-trial hearing and trial date were scheduled on August 17 and August 29, 2022, respectively, during the status hearing on May 12.&nbsp;Due to combined continuances, the hearings and trials have been rescheduled for mid-November and mid-February 2023, respectively.</p><h2>Jorge Masvidal’s Net Worth</h2><p>Jorge does not seem to have declared anything about his net worth, implying that he is a little coy about his finances. Jorge’s net worth is expected to exceed $6 million by 2022, according to Celebrity Net Worth. However, the athlete must still affirm this information.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Jorge-Masvidal-2.jpg alt="Jorge Masvidal" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the photographs he posts on social media, Jorge seems to relish living a high life and spending his money like a king.
