However, for Diggs, his father has always been his role model, and he has always wanted to be like him.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>While his father doesn’t necessarily identify himself as gay, Diggs confessed that he has&nbsp;known his father's boyfriends throughout his&nbsp;life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“This is the dude I want to be — the most charismatic person in the room, always,” he stated in a 2016 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Esquire.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During the interview, Diggs also discussed the expectations that come with being a man. According to him, masculinity is a construct, but there's always a lot of pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>He further explained that masculinity, in part, was about the&nbsp;sense that one can keep the people nearest to them&nbsp;safe, which could&nbsp;sometimes get tricky. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Although he has been infusing these sentiments into his music for years, they appear to be more accessible to his audience in the past few years.</p><p>"I don't know if it's the world-changing, or if&nbsp;it's my position in the world-changing, or both,"&nbsp;he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>.</p><h2>Diggs Is in a Relationship with His ‘Hamilton’ Co-star</h2><p>Diggs and his girlfriend Emmy Raver-Lampman have been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating</a> each other for quite some time. The couple began their professional relationship before their romantic journey when they both starred in Hamilton in 2015.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Eventually, in 2019, the duo made their reported relationship red carpet official as they attended the Film Independent Spirit Awards together.&nbsp;</p><p>While it is unknown when their romantic affair began, the two were close friends first. Later, in a 2020 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with the Los Angeles Times, Diggs implied the two had been dating for two years.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about his <a href=# rel=follow>Snowpiercer</a> character Andre Layton, the performer revealed he was a stark contrast&nbsp;from his character.&nbsp;According to him, Layton is hyper-observant, and he’s not. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>“I have not even&nbsp;figured out where all the things in our kitchen are because my girlfriend put them where they are, and I still don’t know,” he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He also noted that the couple had been living together in the house for two years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Raver-Lampman and Diggs's Vibrant Southern California Home</h2><p>Diggs and his partner now own a 3,500-square-foot new-build residence in a quiet Los Angeles neighborhood.&nbsp;</p><p>In an April 2021 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">feature</a> in Architectural Digest <a href=# rel=follow>The Umbrella Academy</a> actress, Raver- Lampman revealed that every piece and every decision while creating the interior had such a deep sense of meaning because they were living there. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The house is designed by Cheng, a former set designer who worked as a graphic designer on films including Lady Bird and Beyoncé's music video ‘Hold Up.’ She is the one who steered the couple away from the whole whitewashed California-modern aesthetic and toward a more bright and colorful approach that she felt better suited her clients' personalities.</p><p>With colorful walls, patterned furniture tossed around, and some original art and decorations designed by Raver-Lampman herself, the place feels quirky yet sophisticated.</p><p>The artistic couple also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mentioned</a> they are overjoyed and&nbsp;already feel at home in their new house, even though they have spent only a short time there. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGijoJqknr5wsMCvnJ6cXZm2qLPSZp6asV6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./twisted-black.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Twisted Black net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./90s-con-2023-cast-reunions-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Clueless, Full House Reunion Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
