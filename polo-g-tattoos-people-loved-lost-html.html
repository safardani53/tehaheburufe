The rapper further explained that the tattoo had the number 75710 written below the angel as it was his angel number.</p><h2>Recent Tattoos</h2><p>Almost a month&nbsp;after&nbsp;the interview, Polo got two new tattoos in the memory of his late friend Juice&nbsp;Wrld and his grandmother.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Paying homage to his grandmother, the rap artists got a portrait of her on his left arm with a quote from her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Atop that tattoo, Polo got Juice’s globe icon with the numbers 999 and a straw piercing through it.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair had numerous collaborations on tracks like Flex&nbsp;from his debut album&nbsp;THE GOAT and Hate the Other Side&nbsp;from Juice’s posthumous album&nbsp;Legends Never Die.</p><p>But their friendship went beyond their work. Juice had reached out and showed love to Polo. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Billboard, Polo opened&nbsp;up about his friendship with Juice. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>We was homies before that. We used to kick it with each other every day — not music related, didn’t make no songs, none of that.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rap-up</a>, the 21-year-old shared a picture of his tattoos on his IG story captioned, “STill see my grandmas I still see my guyzzz.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The tattoos were reportedly&nbsp;done by one of the famed artists from VH1’s Black Ink Crew Chicago,&nbsp;Phor, who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> the tattoo in his Instagram feed on July 14, 2020, and tagged Polo.</p><p>In the post's caption, Phor tagged Polo and disclosed that the rapper had got these tattoos in his grandma and his friend Juice’s memory.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Story Behind The 999</h2><p>For fans wondering why Polo put the 999 in his tribute tattoo for Juicy, here is why.</p><p>In his July 24, 2018 interview, the rapper mentioned that like the number 666 is associated with the devil, the number 999 is associated with taking all the negativity you have in your life and turning it into a motivating factor for yourself.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The rapper, whose real name is Jarad A. Higgins, died in December 2019 at 21 after suffering a seizure caused by an accidental overdose of oxycodone and codeine.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W8rbuMoGStmaSpvLC%2FjKmcqKicmnqtu9Wem2akn6jBb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tallia-storm-leaves-little-imagination-racy-mermaid-dress.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tallia Storm leaves little to the imagination in racy mermaid dress on exotic holiday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matthew-graves.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Matthew Graves</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brisk-dragon-paradise-sparkling-iced-tea.html>Brisk Dragon Paradise Sparkling Iced Tea: Where can I buy it?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./midnight-mass-season-2.html>Netflix's New Horror Series 'Midnight Mass' Is a Hit, but Will There Be a Season 2?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./see-camille-grammer-act-in-new-tv-gig-2011172.html>See Camille Grammer Act in New TV Gig!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-alison-botha-nearly-survived-the-death.html>What Happened To Alison Botha?
